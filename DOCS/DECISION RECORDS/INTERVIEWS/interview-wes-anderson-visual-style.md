## Interview Transcript

**CDL: Your films feel like worlds. How do you build the CDL world?**

**Wes:** Symmetry. Warm ochres, tobacco browns, copper accents. Every shot should feel composed—the domino table centered, players on either side like a duel. Overhead shots of the bones laid out like a map. The cigar smoke should drift left to right, always.

**CDL: What does a CDL broadcast look like?**

**Wes:** Chapter cards. "Round One: The Shuffle." Each match introduced with hand-lettered typography on aged paper. The score displayed in a vintage brass frame. Player introductions shot in portrait format, center-framed, looking directly into camera. "This is Miguel. He hasn't lost in four years."

**CDL: Color palette?**

**Wes:** Deep burgundy. Aged cream. Brass. Forest green felt on the tables—not casino green, forest. Black for the dominoes, ivory pips. And always, always warm light. No cool tones. CDL lives in permanent golden hour.

## Decision

**HIRED AS VISUAL STYLE DIRECTOR**

Wes brings an obsessive attention to visual detail that will make CDL instantly recognizable. His vision of "permanent golden hour" and symmetrical composition creates a world, not just a broadcast. The chapter card system and player introduction format are immediately actionable.
