## Interview Transcript

**CDL: Why would Jay-Z care about a domino league?**

**Jay-Z:** Culture. That's all I've ever sold. Roc-A-Fella wasn't a label, it was a lifestyle. 40/40 wasn't a bar, it was a statement. CDL? It's not a domino league—it's Cuban excellence. It's competition in a room full of smoke, where your word matters and the table is the equalizer. That's a brand.

**CDL: How do you position CDL?**

**Jay-Z:** Exclusive but accessible. You can watch, but you gotta EARN a seat at the table. We make the tournament feel like an event—not sports, not nightlife, something in between. Think: if poker and a supper club had a Cuban baby.

**CDL: First move as CBO?**

**Jay-Z:** Merch. But not hoodies with logos. Domino sets. Premium. Wood box, brass inlay, CDL engraved on every bone. You play with our set, you're part of something. Then we do a mini-doc. "The First Four"—follow the final four teams through Tournament I. Post it everywhere.
