## Interview Transcript

**CDL: Your paintings merged Afro-Cuban spirituality with modernism. How does that translate to CDL?**

**Wifredo:** The domino is not just a game—it is ritual. In Cuba, we play dominoes the way others pray. The table is sacred. The bones carry energy. I want CDL to remember this. Not just competition—ceremony.

**CDL: What visual elements do you bring?**

**Wifredo:** The spirits. Ochún, Yemayá—the orishas are present when Cubans gather. I would weave subtle symbols into the design. Not obvious, not religious—but present. A curve that echoes a ceremonial blade. Colors that honor the saints. Those who know, will know.

**CDL: What should people FEEL when they see CDL?**

**Wifredo:** They should feel ancestors watching. The domino table connects past and present. Your grandfather played. His grandfather played. When you sit at that table, you are not alone. CDL should carry that weight—that honor.
