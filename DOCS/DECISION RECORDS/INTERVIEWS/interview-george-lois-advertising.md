## Interview Transcript

**CDL: Your Esquire covers stopped people in their tracks. How do you stop someone for a domino league?**

**George:** You don't whisper. You SCREAM. But you scream something true. A domino slamming on a table—that sound, that violence, that confidence. I want a poster where you HEAR the image. Black background. One domino mid-slam. Motion blur. The word "COMPETE." Nothing else.

**CDL: What's the CDL campaign?**

**George:** "The Table Doesn't Lie." That's the line. In poker, you can bluff. In dominoes? The bones are face-up. Your partner knows if you choked. Your opponent knows if you're finished. The table sees everything. That's the campaign—raw, honest competition.

**CDL: How do you make people care about dominoes?**

**George:** You don't sell the game. You sell the MOMENT. The moment you slam the winning bone. The moment your opponent realizes they lost three moves ago. That's not dominoes—that's DRAMA.
