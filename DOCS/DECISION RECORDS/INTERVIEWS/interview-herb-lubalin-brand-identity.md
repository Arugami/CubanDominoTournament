## Interview Transcript

**CDL: You made typography into art. What do you see in three letters—C, D, L?**

**Herb:** Three letters is a gift. You can make them dance. The C can cradle the D, the L can stand tall like a domino on its edge. Typography isn't just letters—it's architecture. The CDL mark should feel like it was carved into a mahogany table.

**CDL: What's your approach to the logo?**

**Herb:** First, I study the bones. Dominoes have pips, dots, geometry. The logo should echo that—mathematical but warm. I'd explore ligatures, where letters connect and share space. "CDL" should feel inevitable, like it was always meant to exist.

**CDL: Fonts for CDL?**

**Herb:** Custom. We don't borrow—we build. Something with weight, with serifs that feel hand-carved. Modern but rooted. When someone sees that mark, they should smell cigar smoke.
