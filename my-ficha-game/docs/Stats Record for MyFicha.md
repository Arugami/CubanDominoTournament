The goal is to present **just enough** information for newcomers while still offering **rich analytics** for serious/competitive players.

---

## **1\. Essential Stats (Great for New/Casual Users)**

These are the **headline** stats that most players care about at a glance. They provide **instant feedback** on general performance without overwhelming users.

1. **Overall & Mode-Specific Win Rate**  
   * *Overall Win Rate (%)* and *Solo/Team Win Rate (%)*.  
   * Quick measure of how often they win.  
2. **Total Wins**  
   * *Overall* or broken down by *1v1* and *2v2*.  
   * Simple, direct measure of success.  
3. **Longest/Current Win Streak**  
   * Encourages engagement; players love seeing their streak.  
4. **Total Points Scored**  
   * Basic yardstick for how much they’ve played and contributed.  
5. **Pollonas** (Games where opponent scored 0\)  
   * Culturally iconic to Cuban Dominoes; fun bragging stat.  
6. **Viajeras** (Rounds scoring 100+ points)  
   * Another distinct, high-impact marker recognized in Cuban Domino culture.  
7. **Comeback Ratio** (or “Comeback Wins”)  
   * Rewarding and easy to grasp: how often they overcame a big deficit.  
8. **Favorite Partner** (For 2v2)  
   * A fun, social metric.  
   * Could simply show the partner with the highest synergy or best combined win rate.  
9. **Most Challenging Opponent**  
   * Easy for casual players to relate to: “Who do I keep losing to?”

---

## **2\. Advanced Stats (For Competitive/Engaged Users)**

These metrics add **strategic depth** and **technical insight**. Present them in a **“Deep Stats”** or **“Advanced”** tab for players who want to analyze their game more closely.

1. **Performance Against Strong Opponents**  
   * Requires rating comparisons; a more nuanced measure.  
2. **Current vs. Longest Streak Breaker Matches**  
   * How many times did you stop someone else’s streak?  
3. **Turn Efficiency / Tile Efficiency / Pip Count Efficiency**  
   * Reflects deeper strategy: how quickly you close rounds, how effectively you use your tiles vs. pips.  
4. **Momentum Recovery** (%)  
   * Already partially captured by “Comeback Ratio,” but the advanced version can show *percent of games* recovered from a certain deficit.  
5. **Knock Performance** & **Knock Efficiency**  
   * Niche but valuable for advanced players who want to see if passing strategy is paying off.  
6. **Round Control Percentage** / **Blocked Round Win %**  
   * Shows who often forces blocks or passes.  
7. **Capicuas** (Detailed Tracking)  
   * While the number of Capicuas might be an essential bragging stat, deeper breakdown (like “Capicuas in blocked games,” “Capicua Efficiency,” etc.) can go into the advanced tab.  
8. **Doubles and Specials**  
   * *Doubles Placement Efficiency*, *Double Block Usage*, *Double Burden Rate*, etc., can be interesting but are more niche.  
9. **Blocking and Denial** (Success rates)  
   * *Number Denial Rate*, *Critical Blocks*, etc. are advanced strategic metrics.  
10. **Opponent Number Tracking Accuracy** & **Opponent Bluff Susceptibility**  
* Very in-depth, arguably for serious competitive or training analysis.  
11. **Control Plays Established** / **Control Play Efficiency**  
* For high-level strategy discussions.  
12. **Opening Number Success Metrics** (detailed breakdown)  
* *Win Rate When Opening with 0–9*, *Blocked Game Frequency Per Opening Number*, etc.  
13. **Tile-Specific Stats**  
* *Most Frequent Tile Played*, *Blocked Game Frequency by Number*, *Team Opening Tile Success,* etc.  
14. **Match Context and Trends**  
* e.g., *Win Rate by Opponent Skill Tier* and *Average Margin of Victory Against Strong Opponents.*

## **3\. Overly Detailed / Potentially Confusing Metrics**

Some metrics might be **too granular** or **very similar** to others, leading to confusion:

1. **Round Control Percentage vs. Number Denial Rate**  
   * Both revolve around controlling the board or forcing passes. They could be simplified into a single stat or left for advanced analysis only.  
2. **Blocked Round Points Differential**  
   * Very niche—how many points you gain in blocked rounds vs. unblocked rounds. This is extremely detailed and might be best for **internal** analytics or advanced stats.  
3. **Partner Salvage Rate**  
   * This is interesting but extremely specific. It could be included in advanced stats if you want to highlight synergy in 2v2, but it might be too obscure for most players.  
4. **Opponent Bluff Susceptibility**  
   * Fascinating but very hard to measure accurately (requires a robust definition of “bluffing” in a digital environment). Could easily be confusing or inaccurate, so treat carefully or omit.  
5. **Opponent Number Tracking Accuracy**  
   * Another advanced concept that might be too intangible for many players.  
6. **Double Burden Rate**  
   * The percentage of doubles left in your hand at the end of a blocked round is super granular. Likely only of interest to a small fraction of advanced players.

---

## **4\. Metrics to Unify or Merge**

Some metrics are **essentially the same** or **too redundant** when broken down by 1v1 vs. 2v2 vs. Overall. You can unify them in a single stat with a simple toggle or filter (1v1 vs. 2v2) instead of repeating everything. For instance:

1. **Pollonas / Pollonas Against**  
   * The concept is the same in 1v1 or 2v2. You can unify it under “Pollonas For” / “Pollonas Against,” with an optional filter for “All,” “1v1,” or “2v2.”  
2. **Viajeras** / **Viajeras Against**  
   * Again, unify these under a single label with a mode toggle.  
3. **Point Efficiency Metrics** (Tile Efficiency, Turn Efficiency, Pip Count Efficiency)  
   * Instead of having separate “Overall” and “Solo/Team” versions, keep the same metric but allow the user to filter by mode. One chart or table could show “All Matches,” “Only 1v1,” “Only 2v2.”  
4. **Blocked Rounds** (Block Rate, Blocked Wins, Blocked Points Gained)  
   * Provide a single “Blocking Impact” statistic page or widget with mode filters, rather than multiple separate stats.  
5. **Opening Number Success**  
   * You can unify the concept of “Opening Win Rate” into one table that breaks down 0–9, with filters for 1v1 or 2v2. No need for separate pages.

---

## **Final Recommendations**

* **For New/Casual Users**:  
  * **Highlight** a **small handful** of fun and easy-to-understand stats: Win Rate, Total Wins, Current Streak, Pollonas, Viajeras, Comeback Wins, and a quick call-out to “Favorite Partner” or “Biggest Rival.”  
  * Keep the **UI Clean** with minimal numbers and more visual elements (bars, icons, etc.).  
* **For Serious/Advanced Players**:  
  * Put the **deep strategy metrics** (blocking success, tile efficiency, doubles usage, opening number frequency, advanced synergy stats) **behind an “Advanced Stats”** button or tab.  
  * Encourage them to **explore** these analytics to improve their play.  
* **Overly Detailed Metrics**:  
  * Either **hide** them from the general UI, or nest them even deeper—**“Expert Mode”** toggle—if you want them at all.  
  * Some might be best for **internal analytics** or for special use (like commentary in tournaments).  
* **Unify Redundant Stats**:  
  * Pollonas, Viajeras, Blocking, Opening Number, etc., can be combined into **one set** of stat definitions with a **Mode filter** (1v1 or 2v2) rather than separate duplicates in each section.

By **organizing** your metrics into **Essential** vs. **Advanced**, **removing redundant** or **extremely granular** stats, and **offering filters** instead of separate categories, you’ll maintain a **user-friendly** experience that still **caters to competitive enthusiasts** seeking deeper insights.
