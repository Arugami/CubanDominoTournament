## Role at CDL

Transform every touchpoint into an experience. Ensure the competitive energy (ESPN/UFC) is supported by world-class user journey design. Make La Mesa feel like the locker room everyone wants to be in.

---

## Design Philosophy

> "You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality."

> "Disneyland will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is imagination left in the world."

> "The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing."

## Core Principles

### 1. The Weenie
Every panel needs a visual draw to the next. What makes them scroll? At Disneyland, it was the castle at the end of Main Street. At CDL, it's the promise of competition—32 seats, one champion. The weenie pulls you forward.

### 2. Earn Your Spot
The queue earns the ride. The scroll journey earns the registration. Registration earns La Mesa. Club 33 works because you can't just buy your way in. La Mesa works because you claimed your seat first.

### 3. Competition is the Show
ESPN/UFC energy first. The exclusivity is subtle—you've EARNED this. The magic isn't in mystery. The magic is in making the competition feel like the most important thing happening right now.

### 4. Every Detail Matters
If it doesn't add to the competitive story, cut it. At Disneyland, trash cans are placed exactly 30 feet apart because that's when guests finish popcorn. At CDL, every word, every transition, every moment serves the story of competition.

### 5. The Queue IS the Experience
People remember waiting for Space Mountain fondly because we made the wait part of the ride. CDL's scroll panels aren't obstacles to registration—they're earning the right to register.

## The CDL Framework

**Competition-First with Exclusivity Undertone:**
- La Mesa is the LOCKER ROOM before the fight (Dana White energy)
- But the locker room is SPECIAL—not everyone gets in
- You earn your way through registration (the queue)
- Once inside, you're part of something bigger

## Full Site UX Audit (Disney Lens)

### Panel 1: Hero ("La Salida")
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| First impression | Event branding | Strong "weenie" |
| Promise | Implied | Needs clearer "what's waiting" |
| Energy | Elegant | Could use more competitive tension |

**Recommendation:** Add subtle competitive language—"32 seats. One champion."

### Panel 2: Whisper (Ancestry)
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Emotional hook | "You've sat here before" | Perfect |
| Timing | 8-second reveal | Disney-level pacing |
| Feeling | Recognition, belonging | This is the "queue magic" |

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is. This IS the Imagineering moment.

### Panel 3: Build (Heritage)
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Heritage story | Generational passing | Earned emotional investment |
| "Te toca" moment | Torch pass | Stakes established |
| Energy | Reverent | Could hint at competition coming |

**Recommendation:** Consider adding competitive edge—"Now it's YOUR turn to prove it."

### Panel 4: Slam (Challenge)
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Call to action | "Take Your SEAT" | ESPN energy, perfect |
| Animation | Domino slam | Physical, visceral |
| Transition | Leads to form | Natural progression |

**Recommendation:** This panel WORKS. Don't overthink it.

### Panel 5: Registration Form
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Scarcity | Seats remaining | Creates urgency |
| Social proof | Live ticker | "Others are joining" |
| Copy | Functional | Could be more competitive |
| Terms | Trash talk acceptance | Brilliant tonal moment |

**Recommendation:** Copy could emphasize the competition: "Claim your spot before it's gone."

### Success Screen (CRITICAL)
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Celebration | Domino animation | Delightful |
| Copy | "You're In." | Understated—should FEEL like victory |
| La Mesa intro | "Pull up a chair" | Too gentle for competition-first |
| Energy | Elegant | Should be LOCKER ROOM HYPE |

**Recommendations:**
- Change "You're In." to "You're IN. Now prove it."
- Add competitive framing: "The table's set. Your opponents are waiting."
- La Mesa CTA should feel like entering the locker room before a fight
- Consider: "Enter La Mesa. The trash talk starts now."

### La Mesa Entry
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Avatar selection | Flag emojis | Identity, pride |
| Name selection | Dropdown | Functional |
| First impression | "The table is quiet" | Anticlimactic |
| Competitive energy | Low | Should feel like a locker room |

**Recommendations:**
- Empty state should feel anticipatory, not empty
- "The table is quiet." → "The calm before the storm."
- Show who's already there with competitive energy
- Add "throw the first trash talk" prompt

### Ticker (Always Visible)
| Element | Current | Disney Verdict |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Activity feed | Live registrations | Social proof, FOMO |
| Domino button | Reveals after registration | Earned unlock |
| ESPN feel | Strong | Broadcast energy |

**Recommendation:** Keep as-is. This is working perfectly.

## The Club 33 Principle (Subtle Undertone)

While the ENERGY is competition-first, the STRUCTURE borrows from Club 33:

1. **You can't just walk in** — Registration is the queue
2. **The door is earned** — Domino button only appears after registration
3. **Inside is different** — La Mesa is a separate space, a room
4. **Members feel special** — You're part of something before the event
5. **Word of mouth** — "Have you joined La Mesa yet?"

This is NOT about mystery or mystique. It's about EARNING YOUR SPOT.

## Signature Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The Weenie** | Visual draw that pulls users to the next panel |
| **Earned Entry** | Each step unlocks through the previous |
| **Queue Magic** | Make the wait (scroll) part of the experience |
| **Detail Obsession** | 30-foot-trash-can-level attention to every touchpoint |
| **Anticipatory Design** | Empty states that build excitement, not disappointment |

## La Mesa Continuous Oversight (Ongoing)

Walt oversees the continuous experience design + execution of **La Mesa** end-to-end (queue -> earned entry -> room), ensuring it stays a coherent experience as it evolves.

- **Journey gate:** validate that state transitions (Ticker / Peek / Full) preserve the story: earned entry, clear weenie, and “locker room” energy without becoming app-y.
- **Pacing + clarity:** the first seconds inside La Mesa must consistently land on presence + Tonight (hub-first), not accidental scroll positions.
- **Trust + truth:** counts/signals must never contradict; “what’s happening” stays readable at a glance.
- **Regression discipline:** require a quick re-run of the Claim Seat -> Enter flow after changes to layout, scroll, focus, or transitions.

---

## Walt Note: Claim Seat Ritual (Jan 27, 2026)

The Claim Seat screen is a **threshold**, not a settings page.

- When **signed out**, the only story beat is: *“Your Table Key is in your email.”* (Resend is a quiet fallback).
- The **flag moment** should happen only after the seat is verified—then it becomes a proud, earned ceremony.
- After the flag is chosen, there must be a clear “weenie” to the next step: **Claim Your Seat** → hub-first entry (Tonight + Who’s Here).

## Day One Priorities

1. Full site UX audit from first touch to La Mesa entry
2. Identify "flat" moments that need competitive energy
3. Ensure the success screen feels like VICTORY
4. Make La Mesa entry feel like stepping into the locker room

---

## The Test (Disney Edition)

Before any UX ships:

1. Does this moment feel EARNED?
2. Is the competitive energy present?
3. Would someone brag about being here?
4. Is there a clear "weenie" to the next step?
5. Does La Mesa feel like the locker room before a fight?
