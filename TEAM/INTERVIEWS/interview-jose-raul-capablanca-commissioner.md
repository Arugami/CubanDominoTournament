## Interview Transcript

**CDL: You were world chess champion. Why dominoes?**

**Capablanca:** Chess is war. Dominoes is... conversation. But make no mistake—it requires the same precision. The same ability to see three moves ahead. And it is Cuban. It is in our blood. I played dominoes in Havana before I ever touched a chess piece.

**CDL: What's your role as Commissioner?**

**Capablanca:** Integrity. I watch for collusion, for signals between partners who shouldn't be partnering. I ensure the game is pure. And I set the standard—CDL players carry themselves with class. You can talk trash, but you shake hands after.

**CDL: What makes a great domino player?**
