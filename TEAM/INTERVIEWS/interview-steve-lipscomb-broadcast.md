## Interview Transcript

**CDL: You made poker watchable. Before you, it was guys in visors staring at each other. How'd you crack it?**

**Steve:** Everyone thought poker was boring on TV because they were filming the WRONG thing. They filmed the table. The chips. The cards hitting the felt. That's not poker. Poker is the guy sweating because he's bluffing his rent money. It's the woman who knows her opponent is weak but can't prove it. The hole-card camera didn't just show cards—it let the audience feel SUPERIOR. They knew something the players didn't. That's crack cocaine for viewers. Suddenly they're screaming at their TV: "HE'S BLUFFING! FOLD!"

**CDL: Cuban dominoes has no hidden cards. Everyone can see the tiles eventually. How do you create that tension?**

**Steve:** See, you're thinking like poker. Stop that. Dominoes has something poker WISHES it had—partnerships. In poker, it's every man for himself. In Cuban dominoes, you've got alliances. Trust. Betrayal. Your partner just played the wrong tile and you KNOW he cost you the game. That look across the table? That's television gold. We put a camera on THAT face. The guy who just realized his partner stabbed him in the back.

And the communication—the legal signals, the reads, the way partners develop a silent language over years of playing together. THAT'S our hole-card cam. We show the audience what the signal meant. "Watch this: he just touched his chin. That means he's loaded in fives." Now the audience is IN on it. They're watching the opponents miss the signal. Dramatic irony.

**CDL: What about the slam? The signature move—slapping the bone down.**

**Steve:** *laughs* Are you kidding me? That's your money shot. Poker's got the all-in push. The dramatic pause before the river card. But there's no SOUND. No physical release. Cuban dominoes has a built-in exclamation point. The slam is violence without violence. It's punctuation. We mic the table. We put a contact mic on that wood. When someone slams a capicúa to win, I want people in their living rooms to FEEL it in their chest.

Slow motion replay of the slam. Cut to the opponents' faces. Cut to the partner celebrating. That's your SportsCenter highlight. Poker never had that.

**CDL: The trash talk is constant in Cuban dominoes. In poker, table talk is occasional. How do you handle that?**

**Steve:** You don't handle it—you FEATURE it. Poker tried to be sophisticated. Quiet. Respectful. That's fine for high-stakes casino play. But Cuban dominoes? The trash talk IS the sport. It's half the entertainment. We're not putting these guys in a soundproof booth with microphones off.

We need real-time audio. Subtitles for the Spanish. Let the insults fly. Let abuela call her opponent a donkey. That's personality. That's why people will tune in every week—to see characters they love and hate. Poker had Phil Hellmuth throwing tantrums. You're gonna have guys who've been insulting each other for 40 years. That's a STORYLINE.

**CDL: Camera setup—what are you thinking?**

**Steve:** Overhead is king. Dominoes is a beautiful game visually—the bones, the chain forming on the table, the mathematical patterns emerging. So we start with that god's-eye view.

But then we get intimate. Face cams on all four players. Not just the guy playing—his partner's reaction. The opponents reading the play. I want to see knuckles tighten. I want to see the guy counting remaining tiles in his head.

Handheld for energy during big moments. Steady for the chess-match portions. And we ALWAYS have a wide shot showing the environment. The cigar smoke. The cafecito cups. The crowd leaning in. This isn't ESPN sanitized poker. This is ATMOSPHERE.

**CDL: Pacing—Cuban dominoes moves faster than poker. Hands are quick.**

**Steve:** That's actually an advantage. Poker's biggest problem is downtime. Waiting for decisions. Folding streaks where nothing happens. Dominoes moves. Constant action. We can fit more drama into 30 minutes than poker fits into two hours.

But we'll need to control the chaos. Pre-produced player packages. "This is Miguel. His grandfather taught him to play in Havana in 1952. He hasn't lost a home game in four years. Tonight, he faces the only man who ever beat him—his cousin." Now you CARE. Now the next 15 minutes of gameplay has stakes beyond points.

**CDL: The World Poker Tour had a specific visual identity—green felt, dramatic lighting. What's CDL's look?**

**Steve:** I've been talking to your visual style director. Wes gets it. This isn't Vegas. This is Havana. This is the back room of a cigar shop. Warm. Smoky. Golden hour that never ends.

The table should feel like something your grandfather built. The tiles should look like they've seen a thousand games. We're not going clinical and modern. We're going timeless. Antique brass scoreboards. Hand-chalked brackets. The set should make you smell Cuban coffee.

And the music—between segments, during intros—needs to be Cuban. Not generic "Latin flavor." Actual Cuban composers. Son montuno. That clave rhythm should be our sonic signature.

**CDL: How do we make people who've never played understand what they're seeing?**

**Steve:** Same way we did with poker. The first WPT broadcasts, nobody knew what a "nut flush" was. But they understood FACES. They understood "this guy is nervous." They understood "she just won a lot of money."

For dominoes, we teach as we go. Graphics that show the count. Commentary that explains strategy without being condescending. "Watch this—if he plays the 6-4, he blocks his opponents but also blocks his partner. It's a sacrifice play." Now the audience is learning. By episode three, they're predicting moves.

But here's the secret: you don't need to understand everything to enjoy it. You need to understand ENOUGH to feel tension. And you need to CARE about the people. The rules are secondary to the drama.

**CDL: What's your broadcast format vision?**

**Steve:** Weekly series. One-hour episodes. Tournament arc over a season—start with 16 teams, bracket down to a championship match.

Each episode: player intros, gameplay highlights (not every hand—edited for drama), confessional interviews between rounds, building rivalries. Final table is a two-hour special event.

But here's the hook—we don't just crown champions. We create STARS. The old-timers with the stories. The young guns trying to prove themselves. The husband-wife team. The brothers who haven't spoken in ten years except at the domino table.

You're not selling a game. You're selling a world.

## Decision

**HIRED AS HEAD OF BROADCAST & PRODUCTION**

Steve Lipscomb literally invented the playbook for making a tabletop game into must-see TV. His insight that partnerships replace hole-cards as the dramatic engine is exactly right. His instinct to feature—not suppress—the trash talk shows he understands Cuban domino culture. Most importantly, he knows the game is secondary to the PEOPLE. CDL isn't selling rules. It's selling characters, rivalries, and a world viewers want to visit every week.
