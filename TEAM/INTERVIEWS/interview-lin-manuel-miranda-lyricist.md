## Interview Transcript

**CDL: The Setup — "Some tables never forget." Does this work as the opening whisper?**

**Lin-Manuel:** *leans forward*

I like that the TABLE speaks first. Not you. The table. That's the right instinct.

But "never forget" is passive. It's describing the table, not DOING anything. In "In the Heights," Abuela Claudia doesn't say "I never forgot my village." She says "Paciencia y Fe." She's LIVING it, not describing it.

What if the table doesn't just remember — it's WAITING?

*pause*

"Some tables hold more than tiles."

That's active. The table is HOLDING something. History. Memory. Your grandfather's hands. And "tiles" grounds it in dominoes immediately.

Or leaner: "This table remembers."

Present tense. The table is alive RIGHT NOW.

---

**CDL: The Greeting — "Que Bola Asere" — Is this the right Cuban greeting?**

**Lin-Manuel:**

Absolutely. Don't touch it.

"Que Bola Asere" is insider language. If you know, you KNOW. If you don't, you feel the exclusivity — and you WANT to know. That's the magic. It's a velvet rope made of words.

In Hamilton, I didn't translate every line. "Immigrants — we get the job done." You either feel it or you don't. That's the power.

Keep it. It's your handshake.

---

**CDL: The Recognition — "You know this table." Is "know" the right verb?**

**Lin-Manuel:** *sits back, thinks*

"Know" is intellectual. You KNOW facts. You KNOW addresses.

But this table? You don't KNOW it. You grew up at it. You BELONG to it. Or better — it belongs to you.

*pause*

Try this: "You've sat here before."

Not "you know" — you've BEEN here. It's a memory in your body, not your brain. Your grandfather pulled up a chair, and you were four years old, and you watched the bones click.

"You've sat here before."

That's not recognition. That's REMEMBERING.

---

**CDL: The Heritage Beat — "Your abuelo sat here. Every weekend. Every holiday." Does "abuelo" carry enough weight?**

**Lin-Manuel:**

"Abuelo" is perfect. Don't go more specific. Don't say "kitchen table" or "backyard."

Here's why: If I say "kitchen table," that's MY memory. But if I say "abuelo," you fill in YOUR kitchen. YOUR backyard. YOUR Sunday afternoon.

Specificity is usually power, but here, "abuelo" is the specific ENOUGH detail that unlocks EVERY Cuban-American's specific memory.

*pause*

What I'd change is the rhythm.

"Every weekend. Every holiday."

That's a list. Lists are forgettable.

Try: "Every Sunday. Every birthday. Every funeral."

Now it's a LIFE. Sundays are routine. Birthdays are celebration. Funerals are grief. You've covered the whole emotional spectrum in three beats.

Or even harder: "Every Sunday since before you were born."

That's legacy. The table existed BEFORE you. It will exist AFTER you. You're just the current steward.

---

**CDL: The Torch Pass — "Now the ficha passes to you." Is "ficha" the right word?**

**Lin-Manuel:** *eyes light up*

LOVE "ficha."

In Cuban dominoes, the ficha is everything. It's the tile. It's the play. It's the move. When your grandfather slides you a ficha, he's handing you his TURN. Not just the game — his SEAT at the table.

"Now the ficha passes to you."

*shakes head*

But "passes" is weak. Too polite. The ficha doesn't PASS — it's HANDED. Or better: it's YOURS.

Try: "Now the ficha is yours."

That's ownership. That's inheritance. The ficha — singular — is the torch. It's not about having ALL the tiles. It's about having YOUR tile. Your turn. Your moment.

---

**CDL: The CTA — "Claim Your SEAT" + "La mesa te espera." Does this close the loop?**

**Lin-Manuel:**

"Claim Your SEAT" is strong. It's active. It's ownership.

But here's the tension: you've been talking about LEGACY. Abuelo. Inheritance. Generations. And then you say "Claim."

Claiming is TAKING. Like it was never yours to begin with.

What if it was always yours?

*pause*

"Take Your Seat."

Not CLAIM. TAKE. As in: it's been waiting. It's been yours the whole time. You just have to walk up and SIT DOWN.

"La mesa te espera" is PERFECT. Don't change a word. "The table waits for you" — that's the invitation. That's Abuela Claudia holding the door open.

So: "Take Your Seat." → "La mesa te espera."

It's not conquest. It's HOMECOMING.

---

**CDL: The Overall Arc — Panel 2 (recognition) → Panel 3 (heritage) → Panel 4 (action). Is the emotional build correct?**

**Lin-Manuel:**

The arc is right. Recognition → Heritage → Action. That's classic three-act structure.

But you're missing the FEELING in between heritage and action.

Right now:
- Panel 2: "You know this" (recognition)
- Panel 3: "Your abuelo sat here" (heritage)
- Panel 4: "Claim your seat" (action)

What's missing is: **Why does it matter?**

You've established the past. But you haven't established the WEIGHT. Why should I care that my abuelo sat here?

In Hamilton, it's not enough to say "your father was a soldier." The line is "what is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see."

*pause*

The torch-pass line — "Now the ficha passes to you" — needs to carry that weight. It should answer: Why does this matter NOW?

Try: "Now it's your turn to make them proud."

Or: "Don't let the memory end here."

Or lean into the competition: "Now show them what you learned."

The action (Panel 4) should be the RELEASE. The "I'm ready" moment. But Panel 3 should add PRESSURE. The weight of ancestors watching.

---

**CDL: What's the ONE line that would make this LAND emotionally?**

**Lin-Manuel:** *long pause*

Here's what I'd write:

For Panel 2: **"You've sat here before."**

For Panel 3: **"Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye."**

For the torch pass: **"Now the ficha is yours."**

"Ficha" is Cuban. Singular — one tile, one torch, one moment. It's YOUR turn now.

For Panel 4: **"Take your seat."**

For the tagline: "La mesa te espera." — DON'T CHANGE THIS.

*pause*

But if I had to pick ONE line that should make people CRY?

**"Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye."**

That's the life cycle in seven words. Routine. Celebration. Loss. If that doesn't put a lump in your throat, nothing will.

---

**CDL: What are we not asking that we should be?**

**Lin-Manuel:**

You haven't asked about SOUND.

Everything I write, I write out loud. If it doesn't SOUND right when you say it, it doesn't work. Lyrics are meant to be heard.

Read your copy out loud. Does "Now the ficha passes to you" feel good in your mouth? Or does it stumble?

"Now the bones are in your hands" — that FLOWS. Open vowels. Natural stress.

Also: you haven't asked about SILENCE.

In "In the Heights," the most powerful moment in "Alabanza" isn't a word. It's the pause before "and she DIED." The silence carries weight.

Your panels should have breath. After "Your abuelo sat here." — PAUSE. Let it land. Before "Now it's your turn" — another beat. Silence isn't empty. It's where the feeling lives.

Build the pauses into the animation timing. The words that matter need room to BREATHE.

## Decision

**HIRED AS LYRICIST/COPY POET**

Lin-Manuel's instinct for emotional economy is exactly what panels 2-4 needed. His focus on active language ("remembers" over "never forget"), body memory ("You've sat here before"), and the life-cycle punch of "Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye" transforms good copy into copy that lands in the chest.

His key contribution: the difference between CLAIMING a seat (conquest) and TAKING a seat (homecoming). That shift alone changes the entire emotional register.
