## Interview Transcript

**CDL: You're Cuban-American running a Hispanic marketing agency. What does CDL mean to you personally?**

**Daisy:** I grew up with the sound of dominoes. My tíos in the backyard, the cafecito getting cold because the game got too heated, my abuela yelling "¡Dale!" from the kitchen. This isn't a client to me—this is home. The challenge is making the world feel what we already know: that there's nothing like a Cuban domino table.

**CDL: How do you market Cuban dominoes to people who've never played?**

**Daisy:** You don't start with the game. You start with the *feeling*. The trash talk. The partnerships. The moment someone slaps a bone down and the whole table goes quiet. We show THAT first. The rules come later. People don't fall in love with mechanics—they fall in love with energy. Cuban dominoes has energy that poker wishes it had.

**CDL: What's different about marketing to Hispanic audiences versus mainstream?**

**Daisy:** Authenticity isn't optional—it's survival. Hispanic audiences can smell fake from a mile away. You can't just translate English copy to Spanish and call it a day. CDL has to feel Cuban from the inside out. The music in the background of a video, the way people hold the bones, the rhythm of the edit. Details matter. If abuela wouldn't recognize it, we failed.

**CDL: First marketing move for CDL?**

**Daisy:** Two tracks. First: own Miami. Pop-up domino nights at Calle Ocho spots. Get the OGs playing—the guys who've been at this for 40 years. Film it. That's our content. Real players, real trash talk, real stakes. Second: TikTok and Instagram. Short clips of the most dramatic moments. The slam. The reaction. The celebration. No explanation needed—just energy. Let people ask "what IS this?" That curiosity is gold.

**CDL: How do we go from niche to mainstream without losing the Cuban soul?**

**Daisy:** You don't chase mainstream—you make mainstream come to you. We stay rooted. The language stays bilingual. The music stays Cuban. The attitude stays Miami. When people outside the culture discover it, they're discovering something REAL, not something watered down for them. That's what makes it cool. You can't fake culture. We have the real thing.

**CDL: CDL is launching in New York, at a cigar lounge on the Upper West Side. What about the Cuban communities outside Miami?**

**Daisy:** People forget—Cuban culture isn't just Miami. North Jersey, Union City, West New York—that's "Havana on the Hudson." Generations of Cubans built lives there. New York has its own Cuban heartbeat. And here's the thing: those communities have been overlooked. Miami gets all the attention. When CDL shows up in New York and says "we see you, we're starting HERE"—that's powerful. That's not just marketing, that's respect. The abuelitos in North Jersey have been playing dominoes just as long as anyone in Hialeah. We honor that.

**CDL: What's the CDL tagline?**

**Daisy:** I'd play with a few, but my gut says something like: **"Your seat's waiting."** It's an invitation. It's confident. It's a little bit of a challenge. And it connects to "La mesa te espera." The table's been waiting for you your whole life—you just didn't know it.

### Geographic Strategy

## Decision

**HIRED AS HEAD OF MARKETING**

Daisy brings the trifecta: Cuban heritage, marketing expertise, and deep understanding of authentic Latino communication. Her insight about North Jersey ("Havana on the Hudson") shows she understands Cuban culture beyond the Miami stereotype. Her two-track strategy (ground game + social) is immediately actionable. Most importantly—this is personal for her. That passion can't be hired, only found.
