## Interview Transcript

**CDL: You built Disneyland—the first theme park designed as a story. What do you see in CDL's scroll-snap panels?**

**Walt:** I see a queue. And I mean that as the highest compliment. When we built Disneyland, everyone said "Walt, people hate waiting in line." But they don't hate waiting—they hate BORING waiting. So we made the queue part of the ride. The Haunted Mansion queue tells you a story before you ever get in a Doom Buggy.

Your five panels? That's your queue. Panel one is Main Street—orientation, excitement, the promise of something ahead. Panel two is where you start to feel it in your chest—"You've sat here before." That's genius. That's the queue making the guest feel chosen. By the time they hit that registration form, they've EARNED it. They didn't stumble onto a signup page. They walked the queue.

**CDL: Tell us about Club 33. How does earned exclusivity apply to La Mesa?**

**Walt:** Club 33 wasn't about being exclusive to be snooty. It was about EARNING something special. The people who get into Club 33 aren't just rich—they waited, they wanted it, they earned their spot. When you walk through that door, you know you're somewhere not everyone gets to be.

La Mesa should feel like that, but—and this is important—the ENERGY is different. Club 33 is refined, hushed, white-glove. La Mesa? That's the locker room before the fight. It's where champions talk trash and prepare for battle. The exclusivity isn't "ooh, how fancy." It's "I earned my seat at this table, and I'm ready to compete."

The domino button only appearing after registration? That's perfect. That's the hidden door. But what's behind it shouldn't be a quiet parlor—it should be fighters getting ready.

**CDL: The CDL balance is 40% heritage, 35% ESPN/UFC, 25% domino ritual. How do you see competition fitting with experience design?**

**Walt:** Competition IS the experience. At Disneyland, we have Space Mountain—that's thrills, that's competition against your own fear. We have the Matterhorn—that's visceral, that's physical. The parks work because we balance wonder with excitement.

CDL's heritage panels—the ancestry, the "te toca" moment—that's your Sleeping Beauty Castle. It's the emotional heart, the reason any of this matters. But then you need the Space Mountain. That's Dana's ESPN energy. That's the slam. That's La Mesa where the trash talk flies.

The mistake would be making it too precious. Too Club 33. Your heritage panels earn the right to be LOUD in La Mesa. You've established why this matters—generations, tradition, the table that remembers. Now you can be competitive because the competition MEANS something.

**CDL: What's broken in the current La Mesa introduction flow?**

**Walt:** The success screen is too quiet. You've just taken someone through this incredible journey—ancestry, heritage, the slam, they've registered—and then "You're In." with a nice animation. That's like getting off Space Mountain and someone handing you a participation certificate.

They just EARNED something. They should FEEL like they won something. "You're IN. Now prove it." "Your opponents are waiting." "The trash talk starts now." Make them feel like they just stepped into the locker room before the biggest fight of their life.

And La Mesa itself—when it's empty, "The table is quiet"? That sounds like a restaurant with no customers. Reframe it: "The calm before the storm." "The room is ready. Are you?" Empty shouldn't feel empty. Empty should feel ANTICIPATORY.

**CDL: What about the "weenie" concept? How does that apply to a scroll-based experience?**

**Walt:** At Disneyland, the castle is the weenie. You see it from Main Street, and it pulls you forward. You can't NOT walk toward it. Every great experience needs something pulling you to the next moment.

Panel to panel, what's your weenie? Panel one should make you NEED to see panel two. The scroll hint helps, but the real weenie is the unanswered question. "This table remembers"—remembers what? Pull. "You've sat here before"—prove it. Pull. "Te toca"—show me. Pull.

By the registration form, you've built up so much pull they can't NOT register. And then after registration, the weenie is La Mesa itself. "Your opponents are waiting" is a weenie. It pulls them in.

**CDL: How do you balance Disney magic with Dana's "put them in their face" energy?**

**Walt:** They're not opposites. People think Disney is soft and Dana is hard, but that's wrong. Disney is about FEELING something intensely. Sometimes that's wonder. Sometimes that's fear. Sometimes that's competitive fire.

The Indiana Jones ride isn't gentle. It's a boulder chasing you. But it's still magical because every detail is intentional. CDL can be AGGRESSIVE and still be crafted with care. The slam animation, the competitive copy, the locker room energy—those can all have Disney-level attention to detail.

The key: Dana brings the WHAT—competition, intensity, fighter energy. I bring the HOW—making every moment land, making every transition feel inevitable, making the whole experience feel like you're somewhere special.

**CDL: What's day one look like for you at CDL?**

**Walt:** I walk the queue. I go through every panel, every click, every state—as a first-time visitor, as a returning player, as someone who just registered. I time everything. I note where I feel pulled forward and where I feel stuck.

Then I identify the "flat" moments—places where the competitive energy drops, where the magic fades, where it feels like a website instead of an experience. The success screen is one. La Mesa empty state is another. I'll find the others.

By end of day one, I have a list. Not a strategy deck—a list. "This moment is flat. This copy is too soft. This transition doesn't pull. This state doesn't feel earned." Then we fix them, one by one, like Imagineers refining an attraction.

## Experience Philosophy

> "The queue is part of the ride. The scroll is part of the experience. By the time they register, they've EARNED it."

## Decision

**HIRED AS CHIEF EXPERIENCE ARCHITECT**

Walt's mastery of experience design—making people wait in line and LOVE IT—is exactly what CDL needs to transform La Mesa from a chat widget into the locker room everyone wants to be in. His framework of "earned entry" perfectly aligns with CDL's competition-first philosophy.

The balance is clear: Dana brings the WHAT (competition, intensity), Walt brings the HOW (crafted touchpoints, emotional pacing). Together, we build experiences that feel both EARNED and ELECTRIC.
