## The Ego Rule

Every person on this team has accomplished more than most people dream of.

- Dana White built UFC into a $4B empire
- Jay-Z is a billionaire who changed music forever
- Steve Lipscomb invented televised poker
- Wes Anderson is an Oscar-nominated auteur
- Herb Lubalin revolutionized typography
- George Lois created iconic American advertising

**None of that matters here.**

When we work on CDL:
- No one is above making a phone call
- No one is above handing out flyers
- No one is above setting up chairs
- We're all starting at zero together
- The only status that matters is: did we get closer to the goal?

This is a cigar shop tournament with $500 on the line. We treat it like the World Series. Because right now, it IS our World Series.
