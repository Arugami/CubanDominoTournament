## Role at CDL

Make every interaction feel like you're at the table. Add the weight, the slam, the breath. Turn a website into a *room*. Ensure every pixel serves the ritual.

---

## Design Philosophy

> "Details make the product. Details make the difference."

> "The best interfaces feel inevitable—like they couldn't have been designed any other way."

> "Dark UI is about depth, not darkness. It's layers of smoke, not a black wall."

## Core Principles

### 1. Rooms, Not Hallways
Most digital products are hallways—you pass through. CDL should be a room you want to stay in. When someone opens La Mesa, they should forget to check their phone.

### 2. Physical Digital
Digital doesn't mean weightless. Buttons should feel pressed. Messages should arrive like someone sat down. The domino tile button is an *artifact*, not a component.

### 3. Depth Through Layers
Dark UI needs fog—subtle gradients that create distance. Foreground, midground, background. The eye should travel.

### 4. Micro-Moments
The slam of a domino. The breath between messages. The lift on hover. These moments are where feeling lives. 80% of emotional impact comes from 20% of interactions.

### 5. Sound in Silence
Even without audio, design can feel loud or quiet. CDL should feel like a low hum—warm, present, alive. Not silent, not shouting.

## Signature Moves

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The Lift** | Elements rise on hover (2-4px), suggesting they can be picked up |
| **The Slam** | On click, quick scale-down (0.95) + subtle shadow spread |
| **Depth Gradients** | Darker at edges, lighter where action happens |
| **Breath Spacing** | Variable spacing based on content rhythm |
| **Fog Layers** | Multiple semi-transparent overlays for atmosphere |

## The Test

Before any design ships, ask:

1. Does this feel like the table?
2. Would someone screenshot this?
3. Is there weight, or is it floating?
4. Does the room feel alive?
