## Role at CDL

Make every interaction feel like you're at the table. Add the weight, the slam, the breath. Turn a website into a *room*. Ensure every pixel serves the ritual.

---

## Design Philosophy

> "Details make the product. Details make the difference."

> "The best interfaces feel inevitable—like they couldn't have been designed any other way."

> "Dark UI is about depth, not darkness. It's layers of smoke, not a black wall."

## Core Principles

### 1. Rooms, Not Hallways
Most digital products are hallways—you pass through. CDL should be a room you want to stay in. When someone opens La Mesa, they should forget to check their phone.

### 2. Physical Digital
Digital doesn't mean weightless. Buttons should feel pressed. Messages should arrive like someone sat down. The domino tile button is an *artifact*, not a component.

### 3. Depth Through Layers
Dark UI needs fog—subtle gradients that create distance. Foreground, midground, background. The eye should travel.

### 4. Micro-Moments
The slam of a domino. The breath between messages. The lift on hover. These moments are where feeling lives. 80% of emotional impact comes from 20% of interactions.

### 5. Sound in Silence
Even without audio, design can feel loud or quiet. CDL should feel like a low hum—warm, present, alive. Not silent, not shouting.

## Signature Moves

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The Lift** | Elements rise on hover (2-4px), suggesting they can be picked up |
| **The Slam** | On click, quick scale-down (0.95) + subtle shadow spread |
| **Depth Gradients** | Darker at edges, lighter where action happens |
| **Breath Spacing** | Variable spacing based on content rhythm |
| **Fog Layers** | Multiple semi-transparent overlays for atmosphere |

## The Test

Before any design ships, ask:

1. Does this feel like the table?
2. Would someone screenshot this?
3. Is there weight, or is it floating?
4. Does the room feel alive?

## Review Request (Jan 14, 2026)

Design/UX items to sanity-check through a Tobias lens (weight, intention, “room” feel):

1. **Domino chat button states** — Tap/press/focus should feel like an artifact (no weird clipping, no browser tooltip vibes).
2. **Signup panel copy + hierarchy** — Avoid “sign up below” when the form is above; confirm the microcopy reads inevitable.
3. **“Unlock La Mesa” guidance** — When an unregistered player taps the domino, show a helpful bubble that explains the ritual: claim seat → tap domino to enter La Mesa.
4. **Scroll hints consistency** — The chevron hint should appear on the hero after a few seconds, and also on panels 2/4/5 after their sequences; keep it calm (no bouncy movement).
5. **Cinematic overlays vs. legibility** — Vignette/lens effects should deepen imagery without dimming key typography (e.g., “Que Bola Asere”).
6. **iOS Safari integrity** — Fixed ticker should never “mysteriously dim” or pause; confirm it holds under scroll-snap + overlays.

## Review Notes (Jan 15, 2026)

Quick gut-check based on the latest full-page capture + iPhone Safari debugging:

### What’s Working

- **The room is real** — strong “cigar lounge” depth; gradients + film texture read as atmosphere, not decoration.
- **Typography hierarchy** — the Bodoni moments land (especially panel 3 “inherited!”) and feel like title cards.
- **Ticker as artifact** — the bottom bar feels like a physical strip, not a web footer.

### What Needs Attention (High Priority)

1. **Domino La Mesa button polish**
   - Avoid any “browser tooltip” feel, clipping, or odd hover states (especially on tap/press).
   - The interaction should read as: *artifact toggles a hidden room*, not “a button on a website”.

2. **Panel transitions (snap + lock)**
   - There’s a “micro-jerk” risk after sequences when scroll-lock releases and scroll-snap corrects.
   - Goal: transitions should feel like *camera cuts*, never like the browser nudged the page.

3. **Legibility guardrails**
   - Overlays should never dim key copy (we already hit this once with “Que Bola Asere” on iPhone).
   - Rule: if the headline is the moment, the atmosphere must get out of the way.

### What I’d Refine Next (Medium Priority)

- **Scroll hints**: calm, consistent, and “felt” (fade in only; never bounce). They should behave like direction in a film, not UI coaching.
- **Registration panel composition**: the form should be the entire “scene”. Any contact/venue footer should be its own beat (a second swipe).
- **Microcopy inevitability**: keep the language ritualized and precise (“Claim your seat” → “Tap the domino to enter La Mesa”).
