## The Interview

**CDL: You built UFC from a $2M purchase into a $4B empire. What do you see in Cuban dominoes?**

**Dana:** Look, people said the same thing about UFC. "It's just guys fighting in a cage." No—it's competition, it's drama, it's personal. Dominoes? Same energy. You got two people across the table, talking shit, slamming bones. That's not a game, that's a FIGHT. The cigar smoke, the crowd watching, the pressure... we just gotta capture it right.

**CDL: How do you take CDL mainstream?**

**Dana:** First, we find the characters. Every league needs stars. Who's the villain? Who's the underdog? Who talks the most trash? Then we put cameras on them. We build rivalries. "Tournament I" is the origin story—five years from now people are gonna say "I was there when it started."

**CDL: What's day one look like?**

**Dana:** Day one, I'm at that cigar lounge watching every game. I wanna see who's got IT. The player who slams a domino and stares down their opponent? That's our first star.
