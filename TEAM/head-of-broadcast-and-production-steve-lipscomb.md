## Key Innovation

**The Partner Dynamic**

In poker, it's every man for himself. In Cuban dominoes, partnerships create unique dramatic tension:
- Silent communication between partners
- Legal signals decoded for audience
- Trust and betrayal at the table
- "He just realized his partner cost him the game"

This IS the hole-card cam of dominoes.
