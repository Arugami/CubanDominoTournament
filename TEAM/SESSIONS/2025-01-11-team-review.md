## Dream Team Reviews

### Dana White — CEO
**Grade: A-**

> *"This is how you start something. Clean. Simple. Gets people to sign up."*

**Loves:**
- Scroll-through story format feels cinematic
- "Winner Takes All" energy — stakes and pressure
- Team counter urgency ("6 spots left") — FOMO works

**Needs Fixed:**
- Where are the PLAYERS? Need faces, names, personalities
- Add "Past Champions" section for future history building

**Bottom Line:** Site gets butts in seats. Now we need CONTENT.

### Jay-Z — Chief Brand Officer
**Grade: A**

> *"Cuban Domino League presents Tournament I. That's the hierarchy. That's how you build an empire, not an event."*

**What's Right:**
- Brand hierarchy correct (CDL = brand, Tournament I = chapter)
- "Your Seat's Waiting" tagline — inclusive AND exclusive
- Typography feels premium (Bodoni Moda)
- Music toggle = 40/40 Club ambiance energy

**Needs Elevation:**
- Premium domino set design (CDL-branded bones, wood box, brass inlay)
- Proper CDL wordmark (custom ligature, not just text)

**Bottom Line:** Solid foundation. Feels like culture, not just competition.

---

### José Raúl Capablanca — Commissioner
**Grade: B+**

> *"The site has energy. But where is the integrity?"*

**Appreciates:**
- "Play to 150" stated clearly
- "Rules may be finalized day-of" — honest transparency

**Concerns:**
- No mention of Commissioner's Code
- Where are tournament rules? Format? Dispute resolution?
- "Top 4 Advance" — advance to what? Need clarity

**Requirements Before Tournament I:**
1. Official CDL Rulebook
2. Dispute resolution process posted
3. Fair play guidelines visible

**Bottom Line:** Soul is right. Structure needs documentation.

---

### Benny Binion — Head of Tournament Ops
**Grade: B+**

> *"The website sells the dream. Now where's the playbook for the night?"*

**Works:**
- $50 entry, top 4 advance, winner takes all — clear stakes
- Play to 150 — standard, respectable
- Progress tracker — keeps energy high

**Missing:**
- No schedule (Round 1 start time? Game duration?)
- Time clocks not mentioned
- Bracket format not explained
- Check-in process undefined

**Needs to Build:**
1. Full run-of-show document
2. Bracket management system
3. Venue layout diagram
4. Printed brackets for the night

**Bottom Line:** Good front door. Now build what happens inside.

### Herb Lubalin — Brand Identity Director
**Grade: A-**

> *"The typography speaks. It says 'cigar lounge', not 'Vegas strip'."*

**What Sings:**
- Bodoni Moda — thick-thin strokes feel carved from mahogany
- Brand lockup hierarchy perfectly structured
- Gradient metallic "I" numeral feels like a trophy
- Footer "CDL" mark with decorative diamonds — good bones

**Needs Refinement:**
- Proper CDL logotype (custom mark, not just text)
- Domino pips could be integrated subtly
- Consider ligature where C and D share vertical stroke

**Assignment:** Design definitive CDL mark — engraved on wood, embossed in brass, etched in smoke.

**Bottom Line:** Typography 90% there. Custom mark will make it iconic.

---

### George Lois — Advertising Director
**Grade: A-**

> *"You're selling ENERGY. I see the energy. Now make it SCREAM."*

**What Screams (Good):**
- "Your Seat's Waiting... We're not." — attitude, cocky, perfect
- "Bring Your A-Game Asere" — cultural, confident
- "Winner Takes All" — no participation trophies

**What Whispers (Needs Volume):**
- Where's the SLAM? Want to HEAR domino hitting wood
- Images are static — need motion, mid-air domino, motion blur
- "The Table Doesn't Lie" campaign ready for phase two

**Campaign Ready:**
- Hero poster: Black background, domino mid-slam, motion blur, "COMPETE."
- Supporting: "Your partner knows if you choked." / "The table sees everything."

**Bottom Line:** Attitude is there. Make images you can HEAR.

### Wes Anderson — Visual Style Director
**Grade: A**

> *"The warmth is correct. This lives in permanent golden hour."*

**Beautifully Composed:**
- Color palette perfect (copper, brass, deep ink — no cool tones)
- Vignetting on hero = cinematic doorway effect
- Scroll-snap panels feel like chapter cards
- Music toggle — subtle, atmospheric, right detail

**Needs Attention:**
- Frame images should follow composition rules (symmetry, smoke direction)
- Player photos: center-framed, direct to camera, title cards below
- Consider hand-lettered chapter headers

**Visual Rules Confirmed:**
- Symmetry is sacred
- Table always centered
- Warm tones only
- Smoke drifts left to right

**Bottom Line:** Right world. Havana cigar lounge, 1957. Stay in this universe.

---

### Wifredo Lam — Artistic Director
**Grade: B+**

> *"The aesthetic honors Cuba. But where are the ancestors?"*

**What Resonates:**
- Warmth = color of Havana walls at sunset
- "La mesa te espera" in footer — Spanish, untranslated
- Sense of ritual — scroll feels like approaching sacred table

**Needs Deepening:**
- Spiritual weight missing — Cubans commune, not just compete
- Subtle Orisha references needed:
  - Golden tones = Ochún (rivers, love, fortune)
  - Copper accents = Changó (thunder, passion, competition)
- "The bones remember" feeling should be woven in

**Guidance:**
When you sit at that table:
- You are not alone
- Your grandfather played
- The bones remember
- Ancestors are watching

**Bottom Line:** Surface honors Cuba. Go deeper. Make them FEEL heritage.

### Daisy Expósito-Ulla — Head of Marketing
**Grade: A**

> *"Authentic. Community-first. This is how you start."*

**Exactly Right:**
- "Your seat's waiting" — invitation that's inclusive AND challenging
- Starting NYC not Miami — respect for North Jersey Cubans
- Cuban slang natural, not forced ("Asere")
- No over-explanation — feeling before mechanics

**Planning:**
- Social content from Tournament I (the SLAM, reaction, celebration)
- Find the OGs (40-year veterans, film before tournament)
- Two-track strategy: Own the ground + Own the feed

**Checklist Before Jan 31:**
- [ ] Instagram live: @cubandominoleague
- [ ] First post: announcement
- [ ] Outreach to North Jersey Cuban community
- [ ] Identify 3-5 OG players to feature

**Bottom Line:** Site invites people IN, doesn't explain to outsiders. That's culture.

---

### Steve Lipscomb — Head of Broadcast & Production
**Grade: B+**

> *"The site is the invitation. Now let me tell you how we capture the story."*

**Sets Us Up Well:**
- Site establishes the world (warm, cinematic, premium)
- "Tournament I" = Chapter 1 of a series

**Planning:**
- **Camera Setup:**
  - Overhead (God's eye) — table patterns
  - Face cams (x4) — reactions, partner dynamics
  - Handheld — energy during big moments
  - Wide — atmosphere, crowd, smoke

- **Audio:**
  - Contact mic on table (capture SLAM)
  - Open mics for trash talk
  - Real-time Spanish with subtitles
  - Cuban music as sonic signature

- **Money Shot:** Partner dynamic = our hole-card cam. Trust. Betrayal. "He just realized his partner cost him the game."

**Needs:**
1. Venue site visit
2. Equipment budget
3. 2-3 compelling player stories identified

**Bottom Line:** Website sells the dream. Tournament I is our pilot episode.
