## The CDL Soul — Why This Matters

### The Emotional Core

CDL is built around one powerful idea: **"You belong to something older than you."** The table—*la mesa*—has been waiting for generations. This isn't marketing language. It's the truth of every Sunday at abuela's house, every game learned at a borrowed table, every ficha passed from grandfather to grandchild.

### The Aesthetic Balance

| Percentage | Influence | Feel |
|------------|-----------|------|
| **40%** | Cuban Heritage | Cultural warmth, tradition, pride — without the heavy lounge |
| **35%** | ESPN/UFC Broadcast | Modern, sporty, competitive, LOUD when it matters |
| **25%** | Domino Ritual | The game, the slam, the bones |

### What Makes CDL Special

The scroll panels tell a story of inheritance. But La Mesa is where the COMPETITION lives. This is the locker room before the fight. The broadcast booth. The proving ground.

## Current State Analysis

### La Mesa Today — What's Working

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Dark cigar lounge aesthetic | ✅ | Depth, fog, warmth |
| Flags for cultural identity | ✅ | Heritage acknowledgment |
| Real-time presence | ✅ | "X at the table" |
| Activity ticker | ✅ | ESPN broadcast energy |
| Basic messaging | ✅ | Functional |

### What's Missing

| Gap | Impact | Severity |
|-----|--------|----------|
| It's *just* a chat | No reason to return | Critical |
| No community rituals | No daily engagement hooks | High |
| No progression signals | No sense of belonging/status | High |
| No competitive energy | Misses the sports broadcast feel | Medium |
| No spectator experience | Misses drama potential | Medium |

## The Vision — La Mesa as Community Hub

### The Thesis

> "La Mesa isn't a chat widget. It's the digital back room of Mr. Garcia Cigars where the community gathers between games."

---

## The Three Pillars of La Mesa

### Pillar 1: THE GATHERING PLACE
Where players check in daily. Where you see who's around. Where news and trash talk flow. The digital porch of the community.

### Pillar 2: THE BRIDGE TO THE GAME (When MyFicha Launches)
Where tournament drama unfolds. Rankings visible. Challenges issued. Results celebrated. The competitive heartbeat of CDL.

### Pillar 3: THE RITUAL KEEPER
Daily prompts. Player spotlights. Heritage moments. Tournament countdowns. Victory celebrations. The heartbeat of the community.

## Team Roundtable — What Should La Mesa Be?

### DANA WHITE (CEO)

> "La Mesa is the LOCKER ROOM. Before UFC fights, the cameras follow fighters in the back. That tension, that energy—La Mesa should be where rivalries simmer.
>
> Where someone says 'I'll see you at the table tonight' and everyone knows what that means.
>
> Don't make it too nice. Let the trash talk breathe. This is where fighters become legends BEFORE they fight. The anticipation is part of the show.
>
> And when someone wins big? The celebration should be LOUD. Not a notification—a MOMENT."

### JAY-Z (Chief Brand Officer)

> "La Mesa is the 40/40 CLUB for dominos. It's not just where you chat—it's where you're SEEN.
>
> Show who's online, who's winning, who's rising. Create status. The person with 50 wins should feel different than someone with 5. But everyone still sits at the same table. That's the trick—exclusive energy, accessible entry.
>
> Think about it: at the 40/40 Club, you might see me or you might see someone who just got their first big check. Same room. Different tables. But everyone's IN THE ROOM.
>
> La Mesa needs that energy. You're not special until you DO something. Then you're special IN PUBLIC."

### TOBIAS VAN SCHNEIDER (Chief Product Designer)

> "Right now La Mesa is a hallway. We need to make it a ROOM.
>
> Add ambient life—who just won a game, who's looking for a partner, what's happening in 10 minutes. The ticker is good but the chat itself needs depth.
>
> Make messages arrive like someone sitting down. Make the room breathe.
>
> I keep asking: does this feel like a place or a feature? A hallway is something you pass through. A room is somewhere you STAY. When someone opens La Mesa, they should forget to check their phone.
>
> Details: The notification sound should feel like a domino placed, not a ding. The presence indicators should pulse like breathing, not blink like a router. These micro-moments are where the room becomes real."

### WIFREDO LAM (Artistic Director)

> "The ancestors are at La Mesa. Not literally—but the feeling.
>
> When someone enters, it should feel like joining a table that's been playing for 100 years. The pips, the brass, the smoke—these aren't decoration. They're the spirits of the game.
>
> La Mesa must feel *watched over*. Elegguá at the threshold. Ochún in the warm light. The orishas don't speak, but their presence is felt.
>
> Every Sunday, every quinceañera, every goodbye—those moments live in this room. The walls remember. The table remembers. We are just the current players at an eternal game."

### LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA (Lyricist)

> "The words in La Mesa matter. 'X joined the table' is fine. But 'X pulled up a chair' is better.
>
> Every piece of copy should feel like it was spoken at a real table. Not written by a product manager. SPOKEN.
>
> The placeholder says 'Habla...'—good. But cycle it: 'Tu turno...', 'Dilo...', 'Speak...' Keep it alive. Languages should blend like they do at real tables—English to Spanish mid-sentence, back again, the way we actually talk.
>
> Victory announcements: 'X won' is functional. 'X just sent Y home empty' is story. Every message should feel like a line of dialogue in a play about this community."

### GEORGE LOIS (Advertising Director)

> "PUT THE ACTION IN THEIR FACE.
>
> When someone wins a game, don't just say 'X won.' Say 'X DESTROYED Y with a POLLONA.' Make it loud. Make it visual.
>
> The chat should feel like a sports bar when someone scores. Don't whisper—SCREAM when it matters. The dominos aren't quiet when they slam. Neither should La Mesa.
>
> I want to feel the energy through my phone. When there's drama, I should KNOW there's drama without reading a word. Color. Movement. Weight. This is advertising—you're advertising the MOMENT."

### DAISY EXPÓSITO-ULLA (Marketing Director)

> "La Mesa has to pass the abuela test.
>
> If Maria Elena's grandmother walked in, would she recognize it as HER table? Would she see her friends? Would she know how to sit down?
>
> Don't make it so modern that the OGs feel lost. And don't make it so old that Danny thinks it's not for him.
>
> The answer is WARMTH. Both generations understand warmth. The 67-year-old and the 28-year-old both know what it feels like to be welcomed at a table where you belong.
>
> Language test: if you wouldn't say it at your tía's house, don't put it in La Mesa."

### STEVE LIPSCOMB (Broadcast Director)

> "La Mesa is a BROADCAST. Think of it like the World Poker Tour lounge camera.
>
> Who's talking, who's watching, who's about to play. We should see the drama unfold in real-time.
>
> Game starting notifications, live results, the reactions after big plays. Make it a show. The best poker content isn't the cards—it's the FACES. The reactions. The moments between hands.
>
> La Mesa should capture that. When someone challenges someone else publicly, that's CONTENT. When someone accepts, that's a STORYLINE. When they play, that's the MAIN EVENT. La Mesa is the documentary happening in real-time."

### WES ANDERSON (Visual Style Director)

> "The composition matters. Right now La Mesa is functional but not *framed*.
>
> Consider: the chat window should feel like a scene from a film. Symmetrical where possible. The message area centered. The reactions placed with intention.
>
> 'Est. 2025' at the bottom—charming. Keep these details. They make it feel curated, not generated.
>
> Color note: the brass and amber palette is correct. But ensure the hierarchy is clear—who is speaking should be immediately visible through color alone. The system messages should feel different from human messages. Different actors, different color grades."

## Player Personas — Community Reaction Test

### LANDY (The OG, 67)

> "Is this a real table or just another phone thing?
>
> I want to see who's playing, hear the talk, know it's authentic. If it feels like a video game, I'm out. If it feels like Versailles Restaurant on a Sunday? I'm in.
>
> The names matter. Are real Cubans here? The flags help but I need to HEAR the culture, not just see the decorations. If someone can't say 'comemierda' in La Mesa, it's not a Cuban table.
>
> Show me the OGs. Show me the players who've been at this 40, 50 years. I want to know I'm in good company."

### MARIA ELENA (The Keeper, 41)

> "Can I bring my family here? Can my son see the culture?
>
> I want to share moments from games, celebrate with people who understand, maybe teach someone younger. Make it warm.
>
> My grandfather learned at a table like this. Then my father. Then me. Now my son. La Mesa should feel like part of that chain—not a break from it.
>
> Don't make it intimidating. Some of us carry the culture without being the best players. We're keepers too."

### DANNY (The Competitor, 28)

> "Show me the leaderboard. Show me who's ranked.
>
> Let me challenge people directly. I want La Mesa to be where I build my rep before tournaments. This is my proving ground.
>
> I need to see stats. Who has the best record? Who's on a streak? I want to call out the top players and take their spot.
>
> And when I win? Make sure everyone knows. I didn't grind to whisper about it."

### CARMEN (The Connector, 52)

> "I'm not the best player but I bring the energy!
>
> La Mesa should welcome EVERYONE. Not just serious players. Let us casuals have our corner too.
>
> Celebrate the banter, not just the wins. Sometimes the best part of the table is the conversation between games. The chisme. The laughter. The stories.
>
> If La Mesa is only for competitors, you lose the soul. The soul is in the community, not just the game."

### ALEX (North Jersey, 34)

> "Does La Mesa represent US? Union City, West New York, the Jersey Cuban community? Or is this Miami's thing?
>
> I want to see North Jersey pride in here. Make us visible. We've been holding down Cuban culture on the Hudson for decades.
>
> When I log in, I should feel like my crew is there. Not like we're guests at Miami's table.
>
> Regional battles could be HUGE. Jersey vs Miami. Hudson County vs Hialeah. Give us something to fight for."

### GABY (Miami Competitor, 31)

> "Is the competition real? Are the best players here?
>
> I'm not interested in casual chat—I want to find worthy opponents. Make it easy to challenge, easy to play, easy to prove myself.
>
> My abuelo was a legend at Domino Park. I carry that legacy. I need La Mesa to respect that—not treat everyone the same when we're not.
>
> Show me the ranked players. Let me see who's actually good. Then get out of my way and let me play."

## Design Principles for La Mesa Evolution

### Tobias's Room Test

Before any feature ships, ask:

1. **Does this make La Mesa more room-like or more hallway-like?**
2. **Would someone screenshot this moment?**
3. **Does the interaction have weight, or is it floating?**
4. **Does the room feel more alive with this feature?**

### George's Volume Test

| Event Type | Volume Level | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| Quiet | Someone joins | "X pulled up a chair" |
| Medium | Challenge issued | "X just called out Y" |
| LOUD | Game won | "X DESTROYED Y • POLLONA • 150-67" |
| CELEBRATION | Tournament win | Full animation, confetti, broadcast |

### Daisy's Abuela Test

For every feature and piece of copy:
- Would abuela recognize this as her table?
- Would she know how to participate?
- Does it feel warm, not cold?
- Does it pass the "tía's house" language test?

---

## Open Questions for Community Feedback

### To Be Tested

1. **Voice chat** — Do players want audio in La Mesa, or does it break the atmosphere?
2. **Spectator mode** — How much game detail should show in La Mesa? Full board or just outcomes?
3. **Regional rivalry** — Should we formally create Jersey vs Miami channels, or keep it organic?
4. **Badge visibility** — How prominent should achievements be? Status symbol or subtle?
5. **Daily rituals** — What's the right cadence for prompts? Daily? Multiple per day?

### Decisions Deferred

| Topic | Options | Deciding Factor |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Voice chat tech | WebRTC native vs. Discord integration | Cost, complexity, quality |
| Spectator depth | Real-time board vs. commentary feed | MyFicha architecture |
| Regional channels | Formal channels vs. tags | Community size threshold |
| Notification frequency | Real-time vs. digest | User preference testing |
