# THE FINAL CDL LOGO SYSTEM

## The Mark: "The Tile"

The CDL logo arranges the letters C, D, and L within the sacred proportions of a domino tile (2:1 vertical rectangle). The letters are staggered vertically for visual balance.

```
    ┌─────────────┐
    │             │
    │  C          │
    │        D    │
    │             │
    │─────────────│
    │             │
    │      L      │
    │             │
    └─────────────┘
```

**Letter Arrangement:**
- **C** — Upper left
- **D** — Middle right (staggered below C)
- **Divider** — Thin horizontal line
- **L** — Lower center

**Tagline:** LA MESA TE ESPERA ("The table awaits you")

## Complete Logo System Prompts

### Prompt L1: CDL Horizontal Wordmark
```
Horizontal wordmark logo spelling "CDL" for Cuban Domino League. Use the exact
same letterforms as the vertical Tile logo — high contrast strokes, thick
verticals, thin horizontals, geometric curves with subtle serif hints at
terminals. The C, D, and L arranged horizontally with balanced letter spacing.
Letters feel carved, architectural, monumental. Brass color (#d4a574) on dark
tobacco background (#1a120d). Also show in reverse: tobacco on cream (#f5f0e8).
Clean vector design, show at multiple sizes. This wordmark pairs with the
vertical Tile mark for horizontal layouts.
```

### Prompt L2: Full Logotype
```
Logotype spelling "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" for the Cuban Domino League brand.
Elegant serif typeface, Bodoni Moda style — high contrast, refined, timeless.
All caps with generous letter spacing (tracking). The words arranged on one
line or stacked as "CUBAN DOMINO / LEAGUE" centered. Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco
(#1a120d). This logotype appears below the Tile mark in formal applications.
Should feel like a private club name, an institution. Vector typography, show
with proper clear space.
```

### Prompt L3: Primary Lockup (Stacked)
```
Brand lockup for CDL (Cuban Domino League). Vertical arrangement: The Tile logo
at top (C and D above thin line, L below, in domino proportions), then "CUBAN
DOMINO LEAGUE" spelled out below in elegant Bodoni serif, then optional tagline
"LA MESA TE ESPERA" in smaller text at bottom. All elements centered and
balanced. Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco (#1a120d). Proper hierarchy — the Tile is
largest, logotype medium, tagline smallest. This is the primary brand signature
for formal applications, posters, signage. Vector design with clear space
guidelines shown.
```

### Prompt L4: Horizontal Lockup
```
Horizontal brand lockup for CDL. The Tile mark on the left (C/D above line, L
below), vertical divider line, then "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" or "CDL" wordmark on
the right, vertically centered. Balanced proportions — the mark and text should
feel equal in visual weight. Brass on tobacco. This lockup is for horizontal
spaces like headers, banners, email signatures. Vector design, show both the
full name version and the CDL-only version.
```

### Prompt L5: Minimal Lockup (Mark + CDL)
```
Minimal brand lockup combining the Tile mark with CDL wordmark. The Tile (small)
to the left, "CDL" horizontal wordmark to the right, same baseline. Used when
full "Cuban Domino League" is too long. Compact, balanced, still recognizable.
Brass on tobacco and reverse versions. Vector, show at small sizes to prove
legibility. This is for social media, app icons with text, compact headers.
```

### Prompt L6: Logo System Sheet
```
Professional brand identity sheet showing the complete CDL logo system. Dark
tobacco background (#1a120d). Arranged in grid: Top row shows The Tile mark
(primary, reverse, single-color). Second row shows CDL horizontal wordmark
(primary, reverse). Third row shows full "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" logotype.
Fourth row shows lockup variations (stacked, horizontal, with tagline). Bottom
shows size examples and clear space rules. All in brass (#d4a574) or appropriate
color for each version. Clean brand guidelines presentation, Wes Anderson
symmetry. This is the master reference for all logo usage.
```

## The Logo IS:

- A domino tile (2:1 proportions)
- A door / portal / threshold
- An invitation to the table
- Sacred geometry made minimal

# SESSION HISTORY

*Below is the full design session that led to these decisions.*

---

## Opening — Herb Lubalin

> "Three letters. C. D. L. This is a gift. Most brands have five, six, seven letters to wrestle with. We have three. Three letters can become a world. Three letters can become architecture. Three letters, if we're honest with them, will tell us exactly what they want to be."

> "But before we touch a pencil, we study. What are we representing? Not just a league. A ritual. A culture. A sound — the slam of bone on wood. A smell — tobacco and cafecito. A feeling — your grandfather's hands shuffling tiles."

> "The domino itself is our teacher. Two squares joined. Pips that tell a story. Geometry that's been perfected over centuries. We don't ignore this. We honor it."

---

## Part 1: The Brief

### What the Logo Must Do

**Herb Lubalin:**

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Instant recognition** | One glance, you know it's CDL |
| **Works at any size** | From a domino tile to a billboard |
| **Feels carved, not printed** | Weight, permanence, craft |
| **Echoes the domino** | Without being literal or cute |
| **Timeless, not trendy** | This mark should outlive us all |

### What the Logo Must NOT Do

- ❌ Look like a sports league ESPN already has
- ❌ Feel like a Cuban restaurant logo
- ❌ Use a literal domino as a cheap visual pun
- ❌ Rely on color to work (must work in single color)
- ❌ Feel cold, corporate, or generic

---

## Part 2: Team Input

### Wifredo Lam (Artistic Director)

> "The domino in Cuba is not just a game. It is ritual. It is Ifá — divination. The pips are not random; they speak. If we use domino imagery, we must understand: we are invoking something sacred."

**Symbols to consider:**
- The **crossroads** (encrucijada) — where decisions are made
- The **ceiba tree** — sacred in Afro-Cuban tradition, roots that connect worlds
- **Geometric patterns** from Afro-Cuban art — not decoration, but language
- The **double** — two halves joined, partnership, the team

### George Lois (Advertising)

> "A logo is a fist. It hits you. CDL needs to hit. When someone sees this mark, they should feel something in their chest. Not 'oh, that's nice.' It should be: 'What IS that? I need to know more.'"

**His challenges to the team:**
- Can you describe the logo in three words?
- Would this logo work as a tattoo?
- If you saw it on a stranger's hat, would you stop them to ask about it?

### Jay-Z (Chief Brand Officer)

> "The best logos become cultural. Think about it — the Jumpman, the Yankees interlocking NY, the Wu-Tang W. Those aren't just logos. They're symbols that transcend their original context. CDL has to aim for that. Not 'domino league logo.' A symbol that means something bigger."

**Cultural references:**
- Havana social clubs of the 1950s
- Boxing gym logos (raw, powerful)
- Secret society marks (Masons, fraternities)
- Vintage Cuban cigar bands (ornate but confident)

### Wes Anderson (Visual Style)

> "Symmetry is truth. The domino is already symmetrical — two squares, mirrored pips. The logo should honor that. But symmetry without surprise is boring. Find the asymmetry within the symmetry."

**Visual principles:**
- Centered composition
- Mathematical relationships (golden ratio, grid-based)
- Color: brass on dark, or cream on tobacco
- A mark that could be a wax seal, an engraving, a brand iron

### Tobias van Schneider (Chief Product Designer)

> "The logo will live on products. On domino tiles. On table felt. On clothing. It needs to work embroidered, engraved, embossed, printed, stitched, and burned into wood. Test it in every medium before you fall in love with it."

---

## Part 3: Concept Directions

### Direction A: "The Ligature"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "What if C, D, and L weren't three separate letters, but one continuous form? A ligature — letters that share strokes, that lean on each other, that become inseparable. Like partners at the table."

**Concept:**
- Custom letterforms where C flows into D flows into L
- Inspired by Art Deco ligatures and cigar band typography
- The negative space creates subtle domino geometry
- Feels carved, monumental, architectural

**Sketch description:**
```
The C curves into the D's vertical stroke, which extends down
to become the L's base. One continuous ribbon of letterform.
Thick strokes, geometric construction, brass-colored on dark.
```

---

### Direction B: "The Tile"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "We don't avoid the domino — we own it. The CDL letters ARE the pips. Arranged in the geometry of a double-six, the letters become the game."

**Concept:**
- Letters C, D, L arranged within domino tile proportions
- The tile shape is implied, not drawn
- Each letter positioned like a pip
- Works as a square mark or horizontal wordmark

**Sketch description:**
```
A vertical rectangle (domino proportions, 2:1).
Upper half: "C" and "D" positioned like pips
Lower half: "L" centered
Dividing line implied by spacing
The tile border is suggested, not explicit
```

---

### Direction C: "The Monogram"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "The great monograms — Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel — they stack and interlock letters into a single unified symbol. What if CDL became one glyph? Not three letters you read, but one symbol you recognize."

**Concept:**
- C, D, L overlapped and interlocked
- Forms a single unified mark
- Art Deco geometric construction
- Works at tiny sizes (favicons, jewelry)

**Sketch description:**
```
The D forms the central vertical spine.
The C wraps around the D's curve.
The L extends from the D's base.
All three share strokes, creating one dense symbol.
```

---

### Direction D: "The Double"

**Wifredo Lam contribution:**
> "In dominoes, the 'double' is special — both sides the same. What if the logo embraced this? A mark that reads the same from two perspectives. A symbol of partnership, of teams, of the ritual."

**Concept:**
- Ambigram or rotationally symmetrical design
- "CDL" reads (or suggests) from multiple orientations
- References the double-six (highest domino)
- Spiritual/ritualistic undertone

**Sketch description:**
```
A mark that suggests "CDL" but also works rotated 180°.
Geometric, almost mystical construction.
Could be read as letters or as an abstract symbol.
Evokes Santería veves or sacred geometry.
```

---

### Direction E: "The Stamp"

**George Lois contribution:**
> "Forget subtlety. Make it a brand. Like cattle ranchers, like Fight Club soap. A mark that says: this belongs to CDL. Burned into the culture."

**Concept:**
- Bold, chunky letterforms
- Enclosed in a shape (circle, rounded rectangle, shield)
- Vintage quality — feels hand-stamped, imperfect
- Works as a wax seal, a brand iron, a rubber stamp

**Sketch description:**
```
"CDL" in bold condensed serif letters
Enclosed in a rounded rectangle or circle
Subtle domino pip dots as decorative elements
Weathered/distressed texture optional
Text "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" curves around edge
```

---

## Part 4: Typography System

### Primary Typeface Options

**Herb Lubalin's recommendations:**

| Typeface | Rationale | Usage |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Bodoni Moda** | Already on website, elegant serifs, high contrast | Headlines, logo lockups |
| **Custom CDL Serif** | We create our own based on Bodoni bones | Logo only, exclusive |
| **Lubalin Graph** | My slab serif, geometric but warm | Secondary headlines |
| **IBM Plex Sans** | Clean, modern, legible | Body copy, UI |

### Custom Letterforms

> "For the logo itself, we don't use an existing font. We draw custom letterforms that exist only for CDL. This is non-negotiable. The mark must be ours alone."

**Custom letter characteristics:**
- High stroke contrast (thick/thin)
- Geometric construction with subtle curves
- Serifs that feel carved, not printed
- Proportions that echo domino geometry (2:1 rectangles)

---

## Part 5: Color System

### Primary Palette

| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| **Brass** | El Dorado | #d4a574 | Primary logo color, accents |
| **Tobacco** | Habano | #1a120d | Backgrounds, depth |
| **Cream** | Hueso | #f5f0e8 | Paper, light backgrounds |
| **Copper** | Cobre | #b76a3b | Secondary accent |
| **Burgundy** | Vino | #5c1a1a | Tertiary accent |

### Logo Color Rules

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "A logo must work in one color before it earns the right to use two. Design it in black first. Then brass on dark. Then reverse. If it survives all three, it's ready."

1. **Primary:** Brass (#d4a574) on Tobacco (#1a120d)
2. **Reverse:** Cream (#f5f0e8) on Tobacco (#1a120d)
3. **Single color:** Black or white only
4. **Never:** Gradients, drop shadows, or outlines

---

## Part 6: Application Testing

### Where the Logo Must Work

**Tobias's checklist:**

| Application | Size | Considerations |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| **Domino tile back** | 15mm x 30mm | Must be recognizable when tiny |
| **Website favicon** | 32x32px | Square crop, single color |
| **Hat embroidery** | 2" wide | Limited stitch detail |
| **Table felt emboss** | 12" wide | Subtle, not overpowering |
| **Cigar band** | 1" x 3" | Ornate context, must hold its own |
| **Billboard** | 20ft wide | Impact from distance |
| **Social avatar** | 400x400px | Circle crop friendly |
| **Wax seal** | 1.5" diameter | Works in relief/3D |

---

## Part 7: Competitive Analysis

### What We're NOT

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "Study the competition to know what to avoid."

| Brand | Their Approach | Our Counter |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **World Series of Poker** | Playing card suits, Vegas flash | We're intimate, not Vegas |
| **UFC** | Aggressive, metallic, extreme | We're confident, not loud |
| **MLB/NBA/NFL** | Corporate, interchangeable | We're craft, not corporate |
| **Cuban restaurant logos** | Flags, palm trees, clichés | We're elevated, not tourist |
| **Generic domino brands** | Literal domino tiles | We imply, not illustrate |

---

## Part 8: Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

**Each concept will be judged on:**

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Distinctiveness** | 25% | Would you recognize it in a crowd? |
| **Timelessness** | 20% | Will it age well over 50 years? |
| **Versatility** | 20% | Does it work at all sizes and applications? |
| **Cultural resonance** | 20% | Does it feel Cuban? Feel like dominoes? |
| **Memorability** | 15% | Can you draw it from memory? |

### The Lubalin Test

> "Show the logo to a stranger. Don't explain it. Ask them three questions:
> 1. What do you think this is for?
> 2. How does it make you feel?
> 3. Would you wear it?
>
> If they can't answer all three correctly and positively, back to the drawing board."

---

## Part 9: Nano Banana Pro Prompts for Logo Concepts

### Direction A: The Ligature
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). Custom typography where the
letters C, D, and L flow together as one continuous ligature form. Art Deco
influenced, geometric construction with elegant curves. High stroke contrast
like Bodoni but with connected letterforms. The C curves into D's vertical
stroke which becomes L's base — one unbroken ribbon. Brass color (#d4a574)
on dark tobacco brown background (#1a120d). Feels carved into mahogany,
monumental and architectural. Vector logo design, clean white background
for presentation. Show three variations: heavy weight, medium weight, and
with subtle domino pip dots as decorative elements.
```

### Direction B: The Tile
```
Minimalist logo design for "CDL" arranged within domino tile proportions.
The letters C, D, L positioned like pips on a domino — C and D in upper
half, L centered in lower half. The domino tile border is implied through
spacing, not drawn explicitly. Geometric sans-serif custom letterforms.
Brass (#d4a574) on dark background. The negative space between letters
creates the domino's center dividing line. Clean vector design. Show the
mark both as a vertical rectangle and as a horizontal wordmark variation.
Luxury brand aesthetic, not playful or casual.
```

### Direction C: The Monogram
```
Interlocking monogram logo design for letters "CDL". All three letters
share strokes and overlap to form one unified dense symbol. The D's vertical
stroke is the central spine. The C wraps around D's upper curve. The L
extends from D's base horizontally. Art Deco geometric construction, like
vintage luxury brand monograms (Louis Vuitton, Gucci style). High contrast
strokes, brass color (#d4a574) on tobacco brown (#1a120d). Works at small
sizes like jewelry or wax seals. Vector logo, show on white background with
size variations demonstrating scalability.
```

### Direction D: The Double (Ambigram)
```
Ambigram logo design for "CDL" that suggests the letterforms from multiple
orientations or appears symmetrical when rotated 180 degrees. Inspired by
sacred geometry and Afro-Cuban symbolic patterns. Geometric construction
using circles, lines, and curves. Could be read as letters or as an abstract
mystical symbol. References the "double" in dominoes (both sides matching).
Brass and cream colors on dark background. Spiritual, ritualistic feeling
but still clearly a professional logo. Vector design with geometric construction
lines shown.
```

### Direction E: The Stamp
```
Bold stamp-style logo for "CDL - Cuban Domino League". Chunky condensed
serif letterforms spelling "CDL" large in center. Text "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE"
curves around the top edge, "EST. 2025" at bottom. Enclosed in a rounded
rectangle or circular badge shape. Small domino pip dots as decorative corner
elements. Vintage quality like a wax seal, brand iron, or rubber stamp.
Weathered/distressed texture. Brass (#d4a574) on dark tobacco (#1a120d).
Also show clean un-distressed version. Vector badge logo design.
```

### Logo Presentation Sheet
```
Professional brand identity presentation sheet showing the new CDL (Cuban
Domino League) logo. Clean white background with centered logo mark in
brass color. Below it: horizontal wordmark variation, minimum size examples,
clear space requirements shown with grid lines, and color palette swatches
(brass #d4a574, tobacco #1a120d, cream #f5f0e8, copper #b76a3b). Bottom
section shows logo applications: embroidered on hat, engraved on wood,
printed on business card, embossed on leather. Professional brand guidelines
presentation style. Elegant, minimal layout.
```

### Logo on Products Mockup
```
Product mockup collage showing CDL logo applied across merchandise. Top-down
styled arrangement including: domino tile with logo engraved on back,
leather coaster with debossed logo, brass wax seal with logo impression,
hat with embroidered logo, t-shirt with printed logo, and wooden box with
burned/branded logo. All items arranged on dark wood surface with warm
lighting. Photorealistic product photography style. Shows logo versatility
across different materials and techniques. Wes Anderson symmetrical composition.
```

## Closing — Herb Lubalin

> "The perfect logo already exists. It's waiting for us to discover it. We don't invent it — we uncover it. Somewhere in the geometry of dominoes, in the smoke of a cigar lounge, in the hands of players who've been doing this for generations — the mark is already there. Our job is to find it and give it form."

> "Three letters. C. D. L. Let them tell us what they want to be."

---

## Part 10: Finalist Review

After generating concepts, the team reconvened to evaluate three finalist directions.

### The Three Finalists

**Option A: "The Tile"**
- CD stacked above L with center dividing line
- Horizontal CDL wordmark variant
- Brass on tobacco, minimal, architectural
- **Strongest versatility** — works at any size

**Option B: "The Double" (Geometric/Ambigram)**
- CD with geometric construction lines visible
- Mathematical, mystical, Art Deco
- References sacred geometry and ritual
- **Most distinctive** — stops you in your tracks

**Option C: "The Ornate Double"**
- Intricate linework suggesting rotation
- More decorative, almost calligraphic
- Feels like cigar band typography
- **Most ornate** — premium feel

---

### Team Reactions to Finalists

**Herb Lubalin (Brand Identity Director):**
> "The Tile is the answer. It does what a great mark does — it implies the domino without drawing one. The negative space IS the dividing line. It works on a domino back, on a hat, at 16 pixels. This is the one."

**George Lois (Advertising):**
> "Would you get The Tile tattooed? Yes. Would you stop someone wearing it on a hat? Yes. It passes both tests. It's a fist — clean, confident, hits you. Explain it in three words: 'Domino. Letters. Done.'"

**Jay-Z (Chief Brand Officer):**
> "The Tile has Jumpman energy. Simple enough to become iconic. The Double concepts are more 'secret society' — which has its appeal, but the Tile is more universal. I could see The Tile on merch day one."

**Wes Anderson (Visual Style):**
> "The Tile honors symmetry. The proportions are mathematically satisfying — 2:1 ratio, the golden rectangle implicit. The dividing line created by negative space is elegant."

**Tobias van Schneider (Chief Product Designer):**
> "From a product perspective, The Tile scales perfectly. Favicon, app icon, embroidery, engraving — it survives every medium. The ornate versions will lose detail at small sizes."

---

### Wifredo Lam's Perspective

> "All three speak to me differently. The Tile is the *mesa* — the table where we gather. The layout itself IS a domino. This is honest.

> The geometric Double speaks to Ifá — divination, sacred mathematics. The construction lines feel like a *veve*, a symbol drawn to invoke. This has spiritual weight.

> The ornate Double has the energy of old Havana — cigar bands, social club certificates, baroque confidence.

> But I wonder... can we find something that holds BOTH? The simplicity of The Tile with a whisper of the sacred?"

---

## Part 11: Wifredo's Hybrid Prompts

### Direction W1: The Tile with Sacred Echo
```
Minimalist logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) arranged within domino
tile proportions (2:1 vertical rectangle). Letters C and D positioned in upper
half, L centered in lower half. The dividing line between halves is implied
through spacing, not drawn explicitly. Behind the letters, extremely subtle
geometric construction lines are faintly visible — circles, guides, and arcs
that suggest sacred geometry without overwhelming the mark. Like architectural
scaffolding left as a whisper. The construction lines at 10-15% opacity, barely
there. Brass color (#d4a574) on dark tobacco brown background (#1a120d). Clean
vector logo design. Show three versions: clean without lines, with faint sacred
geometry, and one showing the full construction grid for brand guidelines.
```

### Direction W2: The Double-Six Reference
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) where the three letters are arranged
to subtly reference the double-six domino — the highest tile, six pips on each
side, the tile that opens every game. Letters C and D positioned as a pair in
the upper half like two pips, L centered below. The overall letter arrangement,
when you unfocus your eyes, suggests the classic 6-pip pattern. Geometric custom
letterforms, minimal and architectural. Brass (#d4a574) on dark tobacco (#1a120d).
The double-six is sacred in Cuban dominoes — it holds power, it begins the ritual.
Those who know will recognize the reference. Vector logo, show on dark background
and on cream (#f5f0e8). Include horizontal wordmark variation.
```

### Direction W3: The Crossroads (Encrucijada)
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) inspired by the crossroads — the
encrucijada where decisions are made, where paths meet, where Elegguá waits in
Afro-Cuban tradition. The letters C, D, and L arranged so their strokes create
an implied intersection or cross-like composition. Not a literal cross, but the
feeling of four paths meeting at center. The domino table IS a crossroads — four
players, four directions, fate decided with each bone played. Geometric construction,
brass (#d4a574) on tobacco brown (#1a120d). Subtle, spiritual, for those who know.
Art Deco influenced with clean vector lines. Show the mark in a square format
and as horizontal wordmark. Include version with faint directional guides visible.
```

### Direction W4: The Tile as Portal
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) using domino tile proportions where
the tile shape suggests a doorway — a portal, a threshold. Letters C and D above
the implied dividing line, L below, as if the letters exist on either side of an
entrance. Add extremely subtle depth through the slightest shadow or dimensional
hint — suggesting you could step through into the world beyond. The tile is not
just a shape, it's an invitation. "La mesa te espera" — the table waits on the
other side. Brass (#d4a574) on dark tobacco (#1a120d), architectural and minimal
but with that whisper of dimension. Vector logo design with clean presentation.
Show flat version and version with subtle portal depth effect. Include mockup
on dark wooden surface to show the threshold feeling.
```

## Consensus Evaluation

| Direction | Distinctiveness | Versatility | Cultural Depth | Recommendation |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| **The Tile** | ★★★★☆ | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | **Primary choice** |
| **Geometric Double** | ★★★★★ | ★★★☆☆ | ★★★★★ | Secondary/special use |
| **Ornate Double** | ★★★★☆ | ★★☆☆☆ | ★★★★☆ | Premium applications only |

---

## Team Recommendation

Move forward with **The Tile** as the primary mark, but explore Wifredo's hybrid prompts to see if we can add a layer of spiritual depth without sacrificing versatility.

**Herb Lubalin (closing):**
> "The Tile is our foundation. Wifredo's suggestions could add soul without adding noise. Let's generate these four variations and see if we find the perfect synthesis. Sometimes the answer is 90% there — we just need to find the last 10%."

---

## Final Next Steps

- [x] Generate initial concepts with AI
- [x] Narrow to 3 finalists based on evaluation criteria
- [x] Generate Wifredo's 4 hybrid prompt variations
- [x] Compare against clean Tile for versatility
- [ ] Test finalist at multiple sizes (favicon to billboard)
- [ ] Final selection and brand guidelines

## Part 12: Final Selection

After generating Wifredo's hybrid prompts, the team reconvened to select the winner.

### Team Reactions to Hybrid Results

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "Now we're talking. The proportions are perfect — that 2:1 domino ratio feels inevitable. The version with the faint construction lines? That's the brand guidelines hero shot. But for daily use, the clean version is the mark. This is a logo that knows what it is."

**George Lois:**
> "THAT'S a logo. I can see it on a door, on a hat, on a championship belt. The ones showing it on wood — that's the feeling. It looks like it's been there for 50 years already. Timeless from day one."

**Jay-Z:**
> "The wood door applications are fire. It looks like the entrance to a private club you need to know somebody to get into. That's exactly the energy. Exclusive but welcoming. 'Your seat's waiting' — but you gotta find the door first."

**Wes Anderson:**
> "The symmetry is satisfying. The negative space creating the dividing line — chef's kiss. And the presentations are beautifully composed. The grid of variations feels like a brand book already."

**Tobias van Schneider:**
> "From a product standpoint, this scales beautifully. I can see it working at 16px for a favicon and at 16 feet on a wall. The versions with subtle depth — those work for premium applications. The flat versions work everywhere else."

**Wifredo Lam:**
> "The sacred geometry versions... yes. The construction lines whisper rather than shout. For those who know, they'll see the ritual. For everyone else, it's simply a beautiful mark. This is the balance I was hoping for. The tile IS a portal now — you can feel it."

### THE WINNER: The Tile

**Unanimous decision.** The team selects **The Tile** as the official CDL logo.

---

## Part 13: The Official CDL Logo — Detailed Specification

### Logo Name
**"The Tile"** — internally referenced as the CDL Mark

### Concept Description
The CDL logo arranges the letters C, D, and L within the sacred proportions of a domino tile (2:1 vertical rectangle). The letters are positioned like pips on a domino — C and D as a pair in the upper half, L centered in the lower half. The dividing line between halves is **implied through negative space**, never drawn explicitly. This creates a mark that IS a domino without depicting one literally.

### Visual Specifications

**Proportions:**
- Overall shape: 2:1 vertical rectangle (domino proportions)
- Upper half: C (left) and D (right), balanced
- Lower half: L centered
- Dividing line: Created by vertical spacing between upper and lower letters
- Border: Implied by letter positioning, not drawn (open tile) OR subtle rounded rectangle frame (contained tile)

**Typography:**
- Custom geometric sans-serif letterforms
- High stroke contrast influenced by Bodoni but simplified
- Letters feel carved, architectural, monumental
- C: Geometric curve, clean terminals
- D: Strong vertical spine, geometric curve
- L: Horizontal base extends to define lower boundary

**Colors:**
| Element | Color | Hex |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Primary letters | Brass / El Dorado | #d4a574 |
| Primary background | Tobacco / Habano | #1a120d |
| Alternate letters | Cream / Hueso | #f5f0e8 |
| Alternate background | Tobacco / Habano | #1a120d |
| Single color | Black or White | #000000 / #ffffff |

**Sacred Geometry Layer (Optional):**
- Faint construction lines visible at 10-15% opacity
- Circles, guides, and arcs that reveal the geometric foundation
- Used for: brand guidelines, premium applications, storytelling
- NOT used for: everyday applications, small sizes

**Depth/Portal Variation (Premium):**
- Extremely subtle shadow or dimensional hint
- Suggests the tile is a threshold you could step through
- Used for: signage, environmental graphics, premium print

### Logo Versions

1. **Primary Mark** — Clean Tile, no frame, brass on tobacco
2. **Contained Mark** — Tile with subtle rounded rectangle border
3. **Wordmark** — Horizontal "CDL" with same letterforms
4. **Construction Mark** — With sacred geometry lines visible
5. **Portal Mark** — With subtle depth/threshold effect
6. **Single Color** — Black or white only, no background

### The Feeling

When you see this logo, you should feel:
- **Confidence** — This is an institution, not a startup
- **Mystery** — What's behind that door?
- **Heritage** — This has been here longer than you think
- **Invitation** — Your seat is waiting

As Wifredo said: *"The tile IS a portal now."*

## Part 14: Refinement Prompts

### Prompt R1: The Primary Mark (Clean)
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). Three letters arranged within
domino tile proportions — a 2:1 vertical rectangle. Letters C and D positioned
side by side in the upper half, letter L centered in the lower half. The
dividing line between upper and lower halves is created purely by negative
space — no line is drawn. Custom geometric sans-serif letterforms with high
stroke contrast, inspired by Bodoni but simplified and architectural. Letters
feel carved into stone, monumental. Brass color (#d4a574) on dark tobacco
brown background (#1a120d). Clean vector logo, no border around the tile —
the letters define the shape through their positioning. Perfectly symmetrical.
Show on dark background, centered, with generous padding. Minimal, confident,
timeless.
```

### Prompt R2: The Contained Mark (With Frame)
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). Three letters C, D, L arranged
within a subtle rounded rectangle border in domino tile proportions (2:1
vertical). C and D in upper half, L centered in lower half. The border is
a thin brass line (#d4a574) with 12px radius corners — echoing the "Bone
Language" design system. Inside, negative space creates the implied dividing
line between upper and lower sections. Custom geometric letterforms, high
contrast strokes. Brass letters and border on tobacco brown (#1a120d). The
contained version feels like a badge, a seal, a mark of membership. Vector
logo, show both the contained version and the open version side by side for
comparison. Clean, architectural, premium.
```

### Prompt R3: The Construction Mark (Sacred Geometry)
```
Logo design for "CDL" showing the geometric construction behind the mark.
The primary Tile logo — C and D above, L below, in domino proportions — with
faint sacred geometry construction lines visible. Circles that guided the
curves of C and D, vertical and horizontal guides that established proportions,
arcs that connect letterforms. The construction lines rendered at 15% opacity
in a slightly lighter brass tone. The effect should feel like architectural
blueprints or da Vinci's geometric studies — revealing the hidden mathematics.
Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco (#1a120d). Show two versions: one with construction
lines barely visible (whisper), one with lines more prominent (for brand
guidelines documentation). Vector design with precise geometry.
```

### Prompt R4: The Portal Mark (Dimensional)
```
Logo design for "CDL" with subtle dimensional depth suggesting a threshold
or doorway. The Tile logo — C and D above, L below — but with an extremely
subtle shadow or beveled effect that makes the tile feel like you could step
through it. Not 3D or skeuomorphic — just a whisper of depth. As if the logo
is carved into a brass plate with the slightest relief. The dividing line
between upper and lower halves could have the subtlest shadow, suggesting a
physical groove. Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco (#1a120d). The effect should be:
"Is that flat or dimensional? I can't quite tell." Premium, mysterious,
inviting. Vector design, show on dark wood texture background to emphasize
the portal/door feeling.
```

### Prompt R5: The Wordmark (Horizontal)
```
Horizontal wordmark for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). The same custom geometric
letterforms from the Tile logo — high contrast, Bodoni-influenced but simplified,
architectural — arranged horizontally as "CDL" with balanced letter spacing.
The letters should feel like they belong together, sharing visual DNA with
the stacked Tile version. Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco (#1a120d). Show the
wordmark alone, and show it paired with the Tile mark (Tile above, wordmark
below, or Tile left, wordmark right). The wordmark is used when vertical
space is limited or when the full "CDL" read is needed. Vector logo, clean
presentation with size variations.
```

### Prompt R6: The Application Sheet
```
Professional brand identity presentation showing the CDL logo system. Clean
layout on tobacco brown (#1a120d) background. Top section: The primary Tile
logo (brass on dark) large and centered. Below it: the contained version
with border, the horizontal wordmark, and the single-color white version.
Bottom section: minimum size examples (showing logo at 16px, 32px, 64px, 128px),
clear space requirements with guide lines, and color palette swatches showing
brass (#d4a574), tobacco (#1a120d), cream (#f5f0e8), copper (#b76a3b). Layout
should feel like a premium brand guidelines page. Wes Anderson symmetry.
Elegant, minimal, professional.
```

### Prompt R7: Environmental Mockup (The Door)
```
Photorealistic mockup of the CDL logo on a dark wooden door or entrance.
The logo is rendered in brass metal, mounted on rich mahogany or walnut wood.
Warm lighting from the side creates subtle highlights on the brass letters.
The setting suggests the entrance to a private social club — intimate, exclusive,
historic. Perhaps a glimpse of warm amber light from inside. The door handle
is brass, matching the logo. The feeling is: "This is the door. Your seat is
waiting on the other side." Cinematic photography, shallow depth of field,
moody lighting. The logo should look like it's been on this door for decades.
```

### Prompt R8: Product Applications
```
Product mockup collage showing CDL logo applications. Top-down styled arrangement
on dark wood surface including: domino tile with logo engraved/debossed on
back, leather coaster with blind deboss logo, brass wax seal with logo
impression, black dad hat with embroidered logo, navy pocket tee with small
chest logo, wooden domino box with burned/branded logo on lid. Warm lighting,
Wes Anderson symmetrical composition. Each product demonstrates logo versatility
across materials: engraving, embroidery, debossing, burning, printing. Premium
lifestyle photography feel. The logo survives and thrives in every medium.

## Part 15: Final Lock — The Definitive CDL Mark

After extensive generation and review, the team unanimously selected the final logo.

### The Winning Image

A three-panel presentation showing:
1. **FLAT** — Clean, minimal, the everyday workhorse
2. **PORTAL DEPTH** — Subtle dimension, letters floating in space
3. **MOCKUP** — Logo on dark wood, the door to La Mesa

With tagline: **"LA MESA TE ESPERA"**

### Team Final Reactions

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "Stop. That's it. The three-panel progression — Flat, Portal Depth, Mockup — that's not just a logo presentation. That's the entire brand story in one image. The flat version is the workhorse. The portal version is the premium. The mockup IS the feeling we've been chasing."

**George Lois:**
> "The one on the wood. That's not a logo anymore — that's a DOOR. You see that and you want to know what's on the other side. That's advertising. That's desire. We're done."

**Jay-Z:**
> "The 'LA MESA TE ESPERA' underneath... chef's kiss. The tagline completes it. The logo says 'CDL', the tagline says 'Your seat's waiting.' Together they're an invitation you can't refuse."

**Wifredo Lam:**
> "The portal depth version... look at it. The letters float. They exist in space. The tile has become what I said it could become — a threshold between worlds. The ancestors are on the other side of that door. This is sacred now."

**Wes Anderson:**
> "The typography. The proportions. The way the L sits alone below the dividing line like a foundation stone. The centered composition. The wood grain texture in the mockup. This is a complete visual system in three panels."

**Tobias van Schneider:**
> "From a product perspective: Flat for digital, small applications, embroidery. Portal Depth for premium print, signage, special editions. Mockup style for environmental, photography, brand storytelling. We have a complete toolkit."

## Part 16: Final Extraction Prompts

These prompts are designed to capture the EXACT letterforms and feeling from the winning design.

### Prompt F1: The Exact Letterforms (Vector Extraction)
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) with precise letterform specifications.
The letters arranged in domino tile proportions (2:1 vertical rectangle). C and D
side by side in upper half, L centered in lower half, separated by a thin horizontal
dividing line. LETTERFORM DETAILS: High contrast typography — thick vertical strokes,
thin horizontal strokes. The C is a geometric open curve with subtle serif flares
at the terminals, not fully rounded. The D has a strong vertical spine on the left
with a geometric curved bowl on the right. The L has a thick vertical stroke and
a horizontal base that extends to the right, grounding the composition. All letters
share the same stroke weight and contrast ratio. The dividing line is thin, matching
the thin strokes of the letters. Brass color (#d4a574) on dark tobacco (#1a120d).
Vector logo, perfectly symmetrical, show isolated on dark background with generous
clear space. This is the master letterform reference.
```

### Prompt F2: The Flat Version (Primary Mark)
```
Clean flat logo for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). Domino tile proportions — vertical
rectangle, 2:1 ratio. Upper half contains C (left) and D (right) side by side.
Lower half contains L centered. A thin horizontal line divides upper and lower
halves. High contrast letterforms: thick verticals, thin horizontals, subtle serif
hints at terminals. The letters feel carved, architectural, timeless. Brass color
(#d4a574) on solid dark tobacco brown background (#1a120d). Below the logo, small
tagline text "LA MESA TE ESPERA" in matching brass, elegant spacing, same typeface
family. Perfectly flat, no shadows, no gradients, no texture. Clean vector design.
This is the everyday, workhorse version of the logo. Show centered with proper
clear space proportions.
```

### Prompt F3: The Portal Depth Version (Premium Mark)
```
Logo for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League) with subtle dimensional portal effect. Same
composition: C and D above thin dividing line, L below, in domino tile proportions.
The letters appear to FLOAT slightly in space — an extremely subtle shadow or
depth effect suggests the tile is a threshold you could step through. The dividing
line has the faintest shadow beneath it, like a physical groove carved into brass.
The letters have the slightest highlight on top edges, shadow on bottom edges —
barely perceptible, creating a "is it flat or dimensional?" effect. Brass (#d4a574)
on tobacco (#1a120d). Below: "LA MESA TE ESPERA" tagline. The overall feeling is
mysterious, premium, inviting — like looking at a door that leads somewhere magical.
NOT 3D or skeuomorphic — just a whisper of depth. Vector design with subtle effects.
```

### Prompt F4: The Door Mockup (Environmental)
```
Photorealistic mockup of CDL logo mounted on a dark wooden door. The logo is
rendered in brushed brass metal — C and D above, thin dividing line, L below.
The brass catches warm side lighting, creating subtle highlights and shadows that
reveal the material. The door is rich dark walnut or mahogany wood with visible
grain. Below the logo, "LA MESA TE ESPERA" is engraved or etched into a small
brass plate. The setting suggests the entrance to a private Cuban social club —
intimate, historic, exclusive. Warm amber light glows faintly from the crack under
the door or through a small window. The feeling: "This is the door. Your seat is
waiting on the other side." Cinematic photography, moody lighting, shallow depth
of field. The logo looks like it's been on this door for 50 years.
```

### Prompt F5: The Three-Panel Presentation
```
Professional brand presentation showing CDL logo in three versions side by side.
Left panel labeled "FLAT": Clean minimal logo, C and D above line, L below, brass
on dark, tagline below. Center panel labeled "PORTAL DEPTH": Same logo with subtle
dimensional effect, letters appear to float, whisper of shadow. Right panel labeled
"MOCKUP": Logo rendered in brass on dark wood surface, environmental application.
All three on matching dark tobacco (#1a120d) backgrounds. Each panel shows the
same letterforms — high contrast, geometric with subtle serif hints. The progression
tells a story: from everyday digital use to premium applications to brand photography.
Clean layout, generous spacing, elegant typography for labels. This is the hero
image for brand guidelines.
```

### Prompt F6: Size Variations (Scalability Test)
```
CDL logo shown at multiple sizes to demonstrate scalability. The Tile logo — C and
D above, thin line, L below — displayed at: 16px (favicon), 32px (small icon),
64px (app icon), 128px (medium), 256px (large), and 512px (hero). All versions
maintain legibility and proportions. At smallest sizes, the thin dividing line
may be simplified or removed for clarity. Brass (#d4a574) on tobacco (#1a120d).
Show each size labeled with pixel dimensions. Below, show the same progression
in single-color white on dark and single-color black on light. Vector presentation,
clean grid layout. Demonstrates that The Tile works at every scale from favicon
to billboard.
```

### Prompt F7: Tagline Lockup Variations
```
Logo lockup variations for CDL with tagline "LA MESA TE ESPERA". Show four arrangements:
1) Vertical stack: Tile logo above, tagline centered below
2) Horizontal: Tile logo left, tagline right (vertically centered)
3) Tile logo above, "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" spelled out below, then tagline smaller
4) Minimal: Just the Tile logo with no tagline (for tight spaces)
All versions use the same high-contrast letterforms. Tagline in elegant serif or
matching geometric type, smaller than logo, proper hierarchy. Brass (#d4a574) on
tobacco (#1a120d). Show clear space requirements around each lockup. Vector design,
brand guidelines style presentation.
```

### Prompt F8: The Wax Seal Version
```
CDL logo rendered as a traditional wax seal. The Tile design — C and D above
dividing line, L below — impressed into dark burgundy or tobacco-colored sealing
wax. The seal sits on aged cream paper or parchment. The impression shows the
letterforms in relief, catching light at the edges. Around the outer edge of the
circular seal, subtle text reads "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE • EST 2025". The wax has
natural imperfections, slight cracks, authentic texture. Warm lighting from the
side. The feeling is official, ceremonial, traditional — like a document seal from
a historic institution. Photography style, top-down view, elegant composition.
This version is for certificates, special announcements, VIP communications.

## The CDL Logo Is Complete

**"Three letters. C. D. L. They told us what they wanted to be."**
— Herb Lubalin

---

## Part 17: The CDL Wordmark with Signature Line (January 16, 2026)

During implementation, a new logo variant emerged for page headers and administrative UI contexts.

### The Problem
The boxed Tile mark, while iconic for brand moments (loading screens, merchandise), felt cramped and heavy in page header contexts like the admin login page. A lighter touch was needed.

### The Solution: Wordmark with Signature Line

```
   CDL
   ───
```

**Specifications:**
- **Typography:** Bodoni Moda, 900 weight, italic
- **Letter-spacing:** 0.08em (tighter than footer's original 0.2em)
- **Gradient:** Brass (#d4a574) to Copper (#b76a3b), vertical
- **Signature Line:** 1px height, horizontal gradient fading at edges
- **Line width:** Proportional to size (50-60px for medium, 28-32px for small)

### Size Variants

| Size | Font Size | Line Width | Use Case |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Small | 1.3rem | 28px | Dashboard corners, compact UI |
| Medium | 2.4rem | 60px | Page headers (login, setup, modals) |
| Large | 2rem | 50px | Footer branding |

### CSS Implementation

```css
.cdl-wordmark {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
}

.cdl-wordmark__text {
  font-family: "Bodoni Moda", "Didot", serif;
  font-size: 2.4rem;
  font-weight: 900;
  font-style: italic;
  letter-spacing: 0.08em;
  background: linear-gradient(180deg, var(--brass) 0%, var(--copper) 100%);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  background-clip: text;
}

.cdl-wordmark__line {
  width: 60px;
  height: 1px;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, var(--brass), transparent);
}
```

### HTML Structure

```html
<div class="cdl-wordmark">
  <span class="cdl-wordmark__text">CDL</span>
  <span class="cdl-wordmark__line"></span>
</div>
```

### Where It's Used

| Location | Size | Context |
|----------|------|---------|
| Admin Login | Medium | Page header above "La Oficina" |
| Admin Setup | Medium | Page header above "La Oficina" |
| Admin Dashboard | Small | Hero stats corner |
| Onboarding Modal | Medium | Welcome message header |
| Main Site Footer | Large | Brand sign-off |

### Design Rationale

**Why the signature line works:**
1. **References the domino divider** — The horizontal line echoes the Tile's central divider
2. **Adds gravitas** — Like a signature beneath a name, it grounds the mark
3. **Creates visual breathing room** — Separates the logo from content below
4. **The fade effect** — Gradient fading at edges feels elegant, not harsh

**Why tighter letterspacing:**
- Original 0.2em felt too spread out at larger sizes
- 0.08em creates a more cohesive, monolithic mark
- Letters feel like they belong together as one unit

### The Hierarchy

```
THE TILE          → Hero moments, loading screens, merchandise
WORDMARK + LINE   → Page headers, administrative UI, footers
WORDMARK (plain)  → Inline text, compact spaces
```
