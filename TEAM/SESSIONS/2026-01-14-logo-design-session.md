# CDL Logo Design Session
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Session Lead:** Herb Lubalin (Brand Identity Director)
**Attendees:** Full Dream Team
**Purpose:** Design the definitive Cuban Domino League mark

---

## Opening — Herb Lubalin

> "Three letters. C. D. L. This is a gift. Most brands have five, six, seven letters to wrestle with. We have three. Three letters can become a world. Three letters can become architecture. Three letters, if we're honest with them, will tell us exactly what they want to be."

> "But before we touch a pencil, we study. What are we representing? Not just a league. A ritual. A culture. A sound — the slam of bone on wood. A smell — tobacco and cafecito. A feeling — your grandfather's hands shuffling tiles."

> "The domino itself is our teacher. Two squares joined. Pips that tell a story. Geometry that's been perfected over centuries. We don't ignore this. We honor it."

## Part 1: The Brief

### What the Logo Must Do

**Herb Lubalin:**

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Instant recognition** | One glance, you know it's CDL |
| **Works at any size** | From a domino tile to a billboard |
| **Feels carved, not printed** | Weight, permanence, craft |
| **Echoes the domino** | Without being literal or cute |
| **Timeless, not trendy** | This mark should outlive us all |

### What the Logo Must NOT Do

- ❌ Look like a sports league ESPN already has
- ❌ Feel like a Cuban restaurant logo
- ❌ Use a literal domino as a cheap visual pun
- ❌ Rely on color to work (must work in single color)
- ❌ Feel cold, corporate, or generic

---

## Part 2: Team Input

### Wifredo Lam (Artistic Director)

> "The domino in Cuba is not just a game. It is ritual. It is Ifá — divination. The pips are not random; they speak. If we use domino imagery, we must understand: we are invoking something sacred."

**Symbols to consider:**
- The **crossroads** (encrucijada) — where decisions are made
- The **ceiba tree** — sacred in Afro-Cuban tradition, roots that connect worlds
- **Geometric patterns** from Afro-Cuban art — not decoration, but language
- The **double** — two halves joined, partnership, the team

### George Lois (Advertising)

> "A logo is a fist. It hits you. CDL needs to hit. When someone sees this mark, they should feel something in their chest. Not 'oh, that's nice.' It should be: 'What IS that? I need to know more.'"

**His challenges to the team:**
- Can you describe the logo in three words?
- Would this logo work as a tattoo?
- If you saw it on a stranger's hat, would you stop them to ask about it?

### Jay-Z (Chief Brand Officer)

> "The best logos become cultural. Think about it — the Jumpman, the Yankees interlocking NY, the Wu-Tang W. Those aren't just logos. They're symbols that transcend their original context. CDL has to aim for that. Not 'domino league logo.' A symbol that means something bigger."

**Cultural references:**
- Havana social clubs of the 1950s
- Boxing gym logos (raw, powerful)
- Secret society marks (Masons, fraternities)
- Vintage Cuban cigar bands (ornate but confident)

### Wes Anderson (Visual Style)

> "Symmetry is truth. The domino is already symmetrical — two squares, mirrored pips. The logo should honor that. But symmetry without surprise is boring. Find the asymmetry within the symmetry."

**Visual principles:**
- Centered composition
- Mathematical relationships (golden ratio, grid-based)
- Color: brass on dark, or cream on tobacco
- A mark that could be a wax seal, an engraving, a brand iron

### Tobias van Schneider (Chief Product Designer)

> "The logo will live on products. On domino tiles. On table felt. On clothing. It needs to work embroidered, engraved, embossed, printed, stitched, and burned into wood. Test it in every medium before you fall in love with it."

---

## Part 3: Concept Directions

### Direction A: "The Ligature"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "What if C, D, and L weren't three separate letters, but one continuous form? A ligature — letters that share strokes, that lean on each other, that become inseparable. Like partners at the table."

**Concept:**
- Custom letterforms where C flows into D flows into L
- Inspired by Art Deco ligatures and cigar band typography
- The negative space creates subtle domino geometry
- Feels carved, monumental, architectural

**Sketch description:**
```
The C curves into the D's vertical stroke, which extends down
to become the L's base. One continuous ribbon of letterform.
Thick strokes, geometric construction, brass-colored on dark.
```

---

### Direction B: "The Tile"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "We don't avoid the domino — we own it. The CDL letters ARE the pips. Arranged in the geometry of a double-six, the letters become the game."

**Concept:**
- Letters C, D, L arranged within domino tile proportions
- The tile shape is implied, not drawn
- Each letter positioned like a pip
- Works as a square mark or horizontal wordmark

**Sketch description:**
```
A vertical rectangle (domino proportions, 2:1).
Upper half: "C" and "D" positioned like pips
Lower half: "L" centered
Dividing line implied by spacing
The tile border is suggested, not explicit
```

---

### Direction C: "The Monogram"

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "The great monograms — Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel — they stack and interlock letters into a single unified symbol. What if CDL became one glyph? Not three letters you read, but one symbol you recognize."

**Concept:**
- C, D, L overlapped and interlocked
- Forms a single unified mark
- Art Deco geometric construction
- Works at tiny sizes (favicons, jewelry)

**Sketch description:**
```
The D forms the central vertical spine.
The C wraps around the D's curve.
The L extends from the D's base.
All three share strokes, creating one dense symbol.
```

---

### Direction D: "The Double"

**Wifredo Lam contribution:**
> "In dominoes, the 'double' is special — both sides the same. What if the logo embraced this? A mark that reads the same from two perspectives. A symbol of partnership, of teams, of the ritual."

**Concept:**
- Ambigram or rotationally symmetrical design
- "CDL" reads (or suggests) from multiple orientations
- References the double-six (highest domino)
- Spiritual/ritualistic undertone

**Sketch description:**
```
A mark that suggests "CDL" but also works rotated 180°.
Geometric, almost mystical construction.
Could be read as letters or as an abstract symbol.
Evokes Santería veves or sacred geometry.
```

---

### Direction E: "The Stamp"

**George Lois contribution:**
> "Forget subtlety. Make it a brand. Like cattle ranchers, like Fight Club soap. A mark that says: this belongs to CDL. Burned into the culture."

**Concept:**
- Bold, chunky letterforms
- Enclosed in a shape (circle, rounded rectangle, shield)
- Vintage quality — feels hand-stamped, imperfect
- Works as a wax seal, a brand iron, a rubber stamp

**Sketch description:**
```
"CDL" in bold condensed serif letters
Enclosed in a rounded rectangle or circle
Subtle domino pip dots as decorative elements
Weathered/distressed texture optional
Text "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" curves around edge
```

## Part 4: Typography System

### Primary Typeface Options

**Herb Lubalin's recommendations:**

| Typeface | Rationale | Usage |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Bodoni Moda** | Already on website, elegant serifs, high contrast | Headlines, logo lockups |
| **Custom CDL Serif** | We create our own based on Bodoni bones | Logo only, exclusive |
| **Lubalin Graph** | My slab serif, geometric but warm | Secondary headlines |
| **IBM Plex Sans** | Clean, modern, legible | Body copy, UI |

### Custom Letterforms

> "For the logo itself, we don't use an existing font. We draw custom letterforms that exist only for CDL. This is non-negotiable. The mark must be ours alone."

**Custom letter characteristics:**
- High stroke contrast (thick/thin)
- Geometric construction with subtle curves
- Serifs that feel carved, not printed
- Proportions that echo domino geometry (2:1 rectangles)

---

## Part 5: Color System

### Primary Palette

| Color | Name | Hex | Usage |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| **Brass** | El Dorado | #d4a574 | Primary logo color, accents |
| **Tobacco** | Habano | #1a120d | Backgrounds, depth |
| **Cream** | Hueso | #f5f0e8 | Paper, light backgrounds |
| **Copper** | Cobre | #b76a3b | Secondary accent |
| **Burgundy** | Vino | #5c1a1a | Tertiary accent |

### Logo Color Rules

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "A logo must work in one color before it earns the right to use two. Design it in black first. Then brass on dark. Then reverse. If it survives all three, it's ready."

1. **Primary:** Brass (#d4a574) on Tobacco (#1a120d)
2. **Reverse:** Cream (#f5f0e8) on Tobacco (#1a120d)
3. **Single color:** Black or white only
4. **Never:** Gradients, drop shadows, or outlines

---

## Part 6: Application Testing

### Where the Logo Must Work

**Tobias's checklist:**

| Application | Size | Considerations |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| **Domino tile back** | 15mm x 30mm | Must be recognizable when tiny |
| **Website favicon** | 32x32px | Square crop, single color |
| **Hat embroidery** | 2" wide | Limited stitch detail |
| **Table felt emboss** | 12" wide | Subtle, not overpowering |
| **Cigar band** | 1" x 3" | Ornate context, must hold its own |
| **Billboard** | 20ft wide | Impact from distance |
| **Social avatar** | 400x400px | Circle crop friendly |
| **Wax seal** | 1.5" diameter | Works in relief/3D |

---

## Part 7: Competitive Analysis

### What We're NOT

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "Study the competition to know what to avoid."

| Brand | Their Approach | Our Counter |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **World Series of Poker** | Playing card suits, Vegas flash | We're intimate, not Vegas |
| **UFC** | Aggressive, metallic, extreme | We're confident, not loud |
| **MLB/NBA/NFL** | Corporate, interchangeable | We're craft, not corporate |
| **Cuban restaurant logos** | Flags, palm trees, clichés | We're elevated, not tourist |
| **Generic domino brands** | Literal domino tiles | We imply, not illustrate |

---

## Part 8: Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

**Each concept will be judged on:**

| Criterion | Weight | Question |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Distinctiveness** | 25% | Would you recognize it in a crowd? |
| **Timelessness** | 20% | Will it age well over 50 years? |
| **Versatility** | 20% | Does it work at all sizes and applications? |
| **Cultural resonance** | 20% | Does it feel Cuban? Feel like dominoes? |
| **Memorability** | 15% | Can you draw it from memory? |

### The Lubalin Test

> "Show the logo to a stranger. Don't explain it. Ask them three questions:
> 1. What do you think this is for?
> 2. How does it make you feel?
> 3. Would you wear it?
>
> If they can't answer all three correctly and positively, back to the drawing board."

## Part 9: Nano Banana Pro Prompts for Logo Concepts

### Direction A: The Ligature
```
Logo design for "CDL" (Cuban Domino League). Custom typography where the
letters C, D, and L flow together as one continuous ligature form. Art Deco
influenced, geometric construction with elegant curves. High stroke contrast
like Bodoni but with connected letterforms. The C curves into D's vertical
stroke which becomes L's base — one unbroken ribbon. Brass color (#d4a574)
on dark tobacco brown background (#1a120d). Feels carved into mahogany,
monumental and architectural. Vector logo design, clean white background
for presentation. Show three variations: heavy weight, medium weight, and
with subtle domino pip dots as decorative elements.
```

### Direction B: The Tile
```
Minimalist logo design for "CDL" arranged within domino tile proportions.
The letters C, D, L positioned like pips on a domino — C and D in upper
half, L centered in lower half. The domino tile border is implied through
spacing, not drawn explicitly. Geometric sans-serif custom letterforms.
Brass (#d4a574) on dark background. The negative space between letters
creates the domino's center dividing line. Clean vector design. Show the
mark both as a vertical rectangle and as a horizontal wordmark variation.
Luxury brand aesthetic, not playful or casual.
```

### Direction C: The Monogram
```
Interlocking monogram logo design for letters "CDL". All three letters
share strokes and overlap to form one unified dense symbol. The D's vertical
stroke is the central spine. The C wraps around D's upper curve. The L
extends from D's base horizontally. Art Deco geometric construction, like
vintage luxury brand monograms (Louis Vuitton, Gucci style). High contrast
strokes, brass color (#d4a574) on tobacco brown (#1a120d). Works at small
sizes like jewelry or wax seals. Vector logo, show on white background with
size variations demonstrating scalability.
```

### Direction D: The Double (Ambigram)
```
Ambigram logo design for "CDL" that suggests the letterforms from multiple
orientations or appears symmetrical when rotated 180 degrees. Inspired by
sacred geometry and Afro-Cuban symbolic patterns. Geometric construction
using circles, lines, and curves. Could be read as letters or as an abstract
mystical symbol. References the "double" in dominoes (both sides matching).
Brass and cream colors on dark background. Spiritual, ritualistic feeling
but still clearly a professional logo. Vector design with geometric construction
lines shown.
```

### Direction E: The Stamp
```
Bold stamp-style logo for "CDL - Cuban Domino League". Chunky condensed
serif letterforms spelling "CDL" large in center. Text "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE"
curves around the top edge, "EST. 2025" at bottom. Enclosed in a rounded
rectangle or circular badge shape. Small domino pip dots as decorative corner
elements. Vintage quality like a wax seal, brand iron, or rubber stamp.
Weathered/distressed texture. Brass (#d4a574) on dark tobacco (#1a120d).
Also show clean un-distressed version. Vector badge logo design.
```

### Logo Presentation Sheet
```
Professional brand identity presentation sheet showing the new CDL (Cuban
Domino League) logo. Clean white background with centered logo mark in
brass color. Below it: horizontal wordmark variation, minimum size examples,
clear space requirements shown with grid lines, and color palette swatches
(brass #d4a574, tobacco #1a120d, cream #f5f0e8, copper #b76a3b). Bottom
section shows logo applications: embroidered on hat, engraved on wood,
printed on business card, embossed on leather. Professional brand guidelines
presentation style. Elegant, minimal layout.
```

### Logo on Products Mockup
```
Product mockup collage showing CDL logo applied across merchandise. Top-down
styled arrangement including: domino tile with logo engraved on back,
leather coaster with debossed logo, brass wax seal with logo impression,
hat with embroidered logo, t-shirt with printed logo, and wooden box with
burned/branded logo. All items arranged on dark wood surface with warm
lighting. Photorealistic product photography style. Shows logo versatility
across different materials and techniques. Wes Anderson symmetrical composition.
```

## Closing — Herb Lubalin

> "The perfect logo already exists. It's waiting for us to discover it. We don't invent it — we uncover it. Somewhere in the geometry of dominoes, in the smoke of a cigar lounge, in the hands of players who've been doing this for generations — the mark is already there. Our job is to find it and give it form."

> "Three letters. C. D. L. Let them tell us what they want to be."
