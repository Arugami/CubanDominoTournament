## Session Format

Tobias invited each team member to do their own walkthrough of cubandominoleague.com and La Mesa. Each brings their unique lens. Tobias listens, synthesizes, and identifies where perspectives align or conflict.

## Wifredo Lam — Artistic Director
*"I look for the soul. Does this feel like the table?"*

### Panel 1: Hero

> "La Salida. The exit. But also the beginning. This is correct—in Cuba, 'la salida' is the first play, the opening move. The name carries weight."
>
> "But the image... it's beautiful, yes. But where are the hands? Dominoes is about HANDS. Weathered hands. Gold rings. The slam comes from the wrist. I want to see humanity."

**Recommendation:** Future hero images should include hands, not just table/tiles.

### Panel 2-3: The Story Panels

> "Que Bola Asere—this is street. This is real. Good."
>
> "'You didn't learn this game, you inherited it.' This is the truth that makes Cuban dominoes different from a bar game. This line should be BIGGER. This is the soul of the brand."

**Recommendation:** Panel 3 headline is the emotional core—consider making it the most visually prominent panel.

### La Mesa Chat

> "The chat is a table. But right now, everyone sits in a row. Real tables are round. Conversations overlap. Maybe... when the room is busy, messages could slightly overlap? Stack? Like voices in a crowded room?"
>
> "The flag next to the name—this is identity. You carry your country to the table. This is correct. But the flag is small. The flag should be PROUD. Not shouting, but present."

**Recommendation:** Consider larger flags, or flag as a more prominent visual element.

### The Domino Tile Button

> "This is a ficha. A bone. When I see it, I think of my grandfather's hands. That is the test—does this feel like memory? Right now, yes. But it hides in the corner like it's ashamed. The domino is not ashamed. The domino ANNOUNCES."

**Recommendation:** Align with George—button needs more presence.

### On Spiritual Elements

> "I see brass. I see warmth. This is Ochún's palette—river goddess, gold, honey. Good. But where is the balance? Yemayá is ocean, depth, blue. A touch of deep blue somewhere—in the shadows, in the depths of the chat—would honor the balance."

**Recommendation:** Consider subtle deep blue accents in shadows/depths for spiritual balance.

## George Lois — Advertising Director
*"Does this make me FEEL something? Or is it just... there?"*

### First Impression (5 seconds)

> "I land on this page. What do I feel? ATMOSPHERE. Good. Dark, smoky, serious. This isn't a game—this is a FIGHT. But..."
>
> *scrolls*
>
> "Where's the TENSION? I see pretty pictures. I see nice words. But where's the moment where I think 'holy shit, this is real'? Every great ad has a moment that stops you. This site needs that moment."

**Recommendation:** Add a "stop moment"—a visual or phrase that creates tension.

### The Headlines

> "'Que Bola Asere' — good, but only Cubans know it. Fine. Mystery is good."
>
> "'You didn't learn this game, you inherited it' — THIS. This is the line. This should be on a poster. On a shirt. This is the truth."
>
> "'Winner Takes All' — obvious. Sports cliché. Find a better way to say it. 'One team walks away with everything. The other walks away with a story.' Something with BITE."

**Recommendation:** Rewrite "Winner Takes All" with more edge.

### La Mesa

> "You have a chat called 'The Table' and people are supposed to care? Make me care. Right now it's just... a chat. Where's the drama? Show me who's talking shit. Show me rivalries forming. Show me someone saying 'I'm going to destroy you on January 31st.' THAT'S a table."

**Recommendation:** Consider featuring bold/spicy messages, or prompting competitive energy.

### The Domino Button

> "You made a beautiful domino and then hid it in the corner like a secret. STOP HIDING. Put the bone in their face. This button should be 50% bigger and it should PULSE. Not a gentle pulse—a heartbeat. This is the heart of the site. Make it beat."

**Recommendation:** Significantly increase button size, add heartbeat pulse.

### Registration Form

> "The form is fine. Forms are boring. What happens AFTER is what matters. When someone signs up, they just joined a WAR. Treat it like that. Confetti is for children. Give them a MOMENT. A sound. A visual that says 'you just stepped into the ring.'"

**Recommendation:** Registration success needs dramatic treatment.

## Wes Anderson — Visual Style Director
*"Is every frame composed? Does the world feel complete?"*

### Overall Composition

> "The scroll-snap panels are good—each is a scene. But the scenes lack... furniture. Every great frame has foreground, midground, background. These panels have background and text. Where's the midground? A domino floating. A smoke wisp. Something to create DEPTH."

**Recommendation:** Add midground visual elements to each panel.

### Color Consistency

> "The palette is warm. Brass, copper, cream. This is correct. But I see inconsistency. The form panel has a different gradient than the others. The chat has pure black where the site has warm black. Every black should be warm. Every shadow should be amber."

**Recommendation:** Audit all colors for warmth consistency. No pure blacks.

### Typography Hierarchy

> "Bodoni Moda for headlines—elegant, timeless. IBM Plex for body—readable, modern. Good pairing. But the sizing feels... arbitrary. Panel 2's headline is the same size as Panel 3's, but Panel 3's message is more important. Visual hierarchy should reflect emotional hierarchy."

**Recommendation:** Resize headlines based on emotional importance, not consistency.

### La Mesa Chat

> "The chat is a room within a room. Good concept. But the room has no... personality yet. Where are the details? A subtle texture in the background. A brass line separating messages. The bones of the room."
>
> "Messages should be framed. Not boxed—that's too harsh. But a subtle left border, like a brass rail. Something that says 'this message is contained.'"

**Recommendation:** Add subtle brass accent details throughout chat.

### Symmetry Report

> "Hero panel: centered. Good."
> "Panel 2: centered. Good."
> "Panel 3: centered. Good."
> "Form panel: LEFT-ALIGNED form. This breaks the world."
>
> "The form should be centered. The entire form container. Center it."

**Recommendation:** Center the registration form container.

### Film Grain

> "Every image feels too clean. Too digital. This is a story about Cuba, heritage, memory. Add film grain. 2-3%. Not visible—felt. The images should feel like they were pulled from a shoebox in someone's closet."

**Recommendation:** Apply subtle film grain to all background images.

## Herb Lubalin — Brand Identity Director
*"Do the letters and symbols do the work? Or is there noise?"*

### Typography Audit

> "Bodoni Moda is carrying a lot. Headlines, button text, chat names. This is good—it creates consistency. But it's being used at too many sizes. I count seven different sizes of Bodoni on this site. Pick four. Maximum. Large, medium, small, tiny. That's it."

**Recommendation:** Reduce Bodoni size variations to 4 maximum.

### The "CDL I" Edition Mark

> "This is good. Simple. Clear. 'CDL I' tells you everything—first tournament. But the typography could be tighter. The space between 'CDL' and 'I' feels loose. Tighten it. Make it feel like a single mark, not two words."

**Recommendation:** Reduce letter-spacing in edition mark.

### La Mesa Logotype

> "In the chat header, 'LA MESA' is set in Bodoni. Fine. But consider: this is the name of a PLACE. A room. It should feel like a sign above a door. Maybe a subtle underline? A brass bar beneath? Something that says 'you have arrived.'"

**Recommendation:** Add subtle brass underline to "LA MESA" header.

### The Free Agent Badge

> "I reviewed Tobias's recommendation. A single pip instead of words. I agree. But consider the pip's weight. It should be exactly the same weight as the pips on the domino button. Visual consistency. Same size, same color, same shadow. They are from the same family."

**Recommendation:** Ensure Free Agent pip matches domino button pip exactly.

### System Messages

> "When the system speaks—'Jordan just arrived'—it should be visually DIFFERENT. Not a message in a box. A whisper across the room. Centered. Smaller. Brass text on transparent background. No box. The narrator doesn't sit at the table."

**Recommendation:** System messages should be typographically distinct—centered, no container.

### Button Typography

> "The 'ENTER' button in La Mesa. The 'REGISTER' button on the form. Both are set in uppercase Bodoni. Good. But the letter-spacing is different. One is 0.2em, the other is 0.08em. Pick one. Consistency is identity."

**Recommendation:** Standardize button letter-spacing across site.

## Tobias van Schneider — Synthesis

*After listening to all perspectives, Tobias synthesizes:*

### Where Everyone Agrees:

1. **The domino button needs more presence** — George says 50% bigger, Wifredo says it's "ashamed," everyone agrees it's hiding

2. **Panel 3 is the emotional core** — "You didn't learn this game, you inherited it" — this is the line that defines CDL

3. **Film grain on backgrounds** — Wes demands it, everyone agrees it adds memory/warmth

4. **The Free Agent pip** — Universal agreement on single pip, Herb adds it must match domino button pips

5. **Warm blacks, not pure blacks** — Wes caught inconsistencies, need to audit all dark colors

6. **Registration success needs ceremony** — George wants drama, this moment is under-designed

### Where Perspectives Differ:

| Topic | Wifredo | George | Wes | Herb |
|-------|---------|--------|-----|------|
| Flag size | Bigger | — | — | — |
| Message overlap | Maybe overlap | — | Frame them | — |
| Hero image | Show hands | Stop moment | Midground | — |
| Blue accents | Yes (Yemayá) | — | Warm only | — |

### Tobias's Ruling:

**On flags:** Slightly bigger, but not dominant. The name is primary.

**On message overlap:** No—clarity over atmosphere in chat. But add brass left border per Wes.

**On hero:** Next photo shoot should include hands. For now, add midground element.

**On blue accents:** Wifredo's spiritual note is important. But not in main UI. Perhaps in success states—a hint of deep blue in the shadows of the celebration moment. Yemayá blessing the new player.
