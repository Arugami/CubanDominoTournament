---

## Panel-by-Panel Review

### Panel 1: Hero (The Invitation)

**Current Copy:**
```
Cuban Domino League
presents
Tournament I
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
[Enter]
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Jay-Z:** Brand hierarchy is correct. CDL is the empire, Tournament I is the chapter.

**Wes Anderson:** "Tournament I" with the golden numeral feels like a chapter card. Exactly right.

**Dana White:** Clean. Gets people curious. The "Enter" button is like walking through a door.

**George Lois:** This is the hook. It INVITES. Don't overthink it.

**Daisy:** Date and venue here is good - people need to know the basics immediately.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - No changes needed

---

### Panel 2: The Greeting

**Current Copy:**
```
Que Bola Asere
We've been expecting you.
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Que Bola Asere" - this passes the abuela test. Real Cuban greeting. Not forced. Perfect.

**George Lois:** "We've been expecting you" - confident, welcoming, slightly ominous. You SCREAM welcome but with an edge.

**Wifredo Lam:** The man with the cigar IS the ancestors welcoming you. The copy matches.

**Capablanca:** This sets the tone - you're entering a world with history and respect.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 3: The Tension

**Final Copy:**
```
You didn't learn this game.
You inherited it!
```

**Image Context:** Man at domino table, intense expression, game is getting heated. This is the moment before everything explodes.

**Team Discussion:**

**George Lois:** "If you can't say it in one breath, it's too much. This panel is about TENSION. Keep it tight."

**Daisy:** "Everyone learned at the kitchen table - abuelos, tíos, Sunday afternoons. Now there's finally a stage for it. THAT'S the emotional truth. 'You inherited it' captures that perfectly."

**Wifredo Lam:** "The bones remember. Your grandfather played. This copy honors the ancestors."

**Dana White:** "The exclamation point adds the energy. This is a statement of PRIDE."

**Why This Works:**
- Short enough to read in one breath ✓
- Captures the heritage/family angle ✓
- Matches the intensity of the image ✓
- Exclamation point adds energy for the tension moment ✓

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 4: The Climax

**Current Copy:**
```
Winning Team Takes All
Are you ready?
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** "WINNING TEAM" - yes. This is about partnership. Two people. That's what makes dominoes different from poker.

**Jay-Z:** High stakes. Clear. "Takes All" is the promise.

**George Lois:** "Are you ready?" - direct challenge. No fluff. Perfect for the table-flip energy.

**Benny Binion:** This is single elimination energy. One shot. Everything on the line.

**Capablanca:** The table flip image shows passion - Cubans FEEL this game. The copy should match that fire.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 5: Registration Form

**Current Copy:**
```
Join The League
Tournament I • Limited to 10 Teams

[X] teams in | [X] spots left
Be one of the first 10 to play

- Two players per team
- Pay $50 on arrival
- Play to 150
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** The counter creates FOMO. "6 spots left" - that's urgency.

**Jay-Z:** "Join The League" - you're not just registering, you're becoming part of something.

**Benny Binion:** Logistics are clear. $50, two players, play to 150. No confusion.

**Daisy:** "Be one of the first 10 to play" - this is history-making language. Good.

**George Lois:** Form copy doesn't need to scream. It needs to be clear. This works.

**Wes Anderson:** The progression from dramatic panels to a clean form feels like the story resolving.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Success Screen

**Current Copy:**
```
Your Team's In.
Check your email for confirmation details

January 31, 2025
Mr Garcia Cigars
Doors open at 6PM

"Your seat's waiting."

Questions? Erik@cubandominoleague.com
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Your Team's In" - team focus. You're not alone. You registered WITH someone. Good.

**Jay-Z:** "Your seat's waiting" as the closer ties back to the brand tagline. Cohesive.

**Capablanca:** Practical details here make sense - they need to know when to arrive.

**Wifredo Lam:** The domino animation on success feels like a celebration. The bones welcome you.

**George Lois:** Clean confirmation. Not the place to oversell. Just say "you're in" and shut up.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

# Revision: January 15, 2026
## Panel 2 Copy Overhaul — Visual Energy Mismatch

**Creative Lead:** George Lois + Dana White
**Focus:** Panel 2 copy didn't match the UFC staredown energy of frame-2.webp

---

### The Problem

After reviewing the actual background images:

| Frame | Visual Energy | Original Copy | Issue |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| frame-2.webp | Man staring down camera, cigar raised, UFC weigh-in energy | "We've been expecting you..." | **TOO SOFT** |

**George Lois:** "You don't whisper when the image is SCREAMING at you. The man in that photo is challenging you. The copy should match."

**Dana White:** "That's a fighter sizing you up. 'We've been expecting you' sounds like a hotel concierge, not a competitor."

---

### Panel Structure Clarification

The actual site has 6 panels, not 5:

| Panel | Name | Background | Content |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Hero | frame-hero.webp | "La Salida" |
| 2 | Whisper | frame-2.webp | Greeting + Challenge |
| 3 | Build | frame-3.webp | "INHERITED" revelation |
| 4 | Slam | frame-4.webp | "Winner Takes All" |
| 5 | Rules | *(no image)* | "La Ley" + rules grid |
| 6 | Form | gradient | Registration |

---

### Panel 2: Revised Copy

**Before:**
```
Que Bola Asere
We've been watching you...
...train
...learn
...wait.
```

**After:**
```
Que Bola Asere
You think you learned this game?
We know better.
We know who you are.
```

**Why the change:**

1. **Challenge matches image:** The man is staring you down. "You think you learned?" is a direct challenge that matches his posture.

2. **Sets up Panel 3:** "You think you learned" → "You didn't learn this game. It was INHERITED." The callback makes the revelation land harder.

3. **Cuban + UFC balance:** "Que Bola Asere" keeps the Cuban soul. The challenge adds Dana White's competitive edge.

---

### Story Flow: Panels 2→3→4

> **Panel 2:** "Que Bola Asere. You think you learned this game? We know better. We know who you are."
>
> **Panel 3:** "You didn't learn this game. It was INHERITED."
>
> **Panel 4:** "Winner Takes All"

**George Lois:** "Now THAT reads like a movie trailer. Challenge → Revelation → Stakes. Each panel builds."

---

### Typography & Animation Changes

**Typography treatment:**
- Challenge line: Upright (not italic), bolder — confrontational
- Counter line ("We know better."): Brass color, snap animation — punchy like a jab
- Mystery line: Italic, glow effect — lingers before INHERITED

**Animation timing:**
- Total sequence: ~5.5s (was ~7s with 4 lines)
- Counter has "snap" overshoot animation
- Mystery line gets subtle glow at end

---

### Team Sign-off

**Dana White:** "NOW it matches the image. That's a staredown."

**George Lois:** "Challenge in, softness out. This passes."

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "Still passes the Abuela test. 'Que Bola Asere' anchors it in Cuban culture."

**Jay-Z:** "The mystery line 'We know who you are' is exclusive energy. You belong here because of your bloodline."

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Updated Summary

| Panel | Original Copy | Revised Copy | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 2 (Whisper) | "We've been expecting you..." | "You think you learned this game? We know better. We know who you are." | ✅ Updated Jan 15 |
| 3 (Build) | "INHERITED" | *(no change)* | ✅ |
| 4 (Slam) | "Winner Takes All" | *(no change)* | ✅ |
| 5 (Rules) | "La Ley" | *(no change)* | ✅ |

# Revision: January 16, 2026
## Panels 2-4: The Heart of the Story — Why It Doesn't Resonate Yet

**Creative Lead:** Full Dream Team
**Focus:** Making panels 2-4 the magical center of the experience

---

### Current Implementation (Documenting What's Live)

| Panel | Position | Current Copy | Animation |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **2 (Whisper)** | Top letterbox | "Que Bola Asere" | Smoke fade-in |
| | Center | "You've been waiting for this." | Blur-to-focus reveal |
| **3 (Build)** | Center | "SO HAVE THEY." | Dawning glow |
| **4 (Slam)** | Top | "January 31 • Mr Garcia Cigars" | Context fade |
| | Center | "Make / Them / PROUD" | Staggered slam |

**Story Arc Intent:**
> YOU've been waiting → THEY (ancestors) have been waiting → Make THEM proud

---

### The Problem: It Doesn't Match the Magic

The rest of the site is *magical*:
- **Hero:** "La Salida" — Spanish, cinematic, chapter-card framing
- **Rules:** "La Ley" — carved brass, ceremonial weight
- **Form:** "La mesa te espera" — ritual invitation
- **Ticker:** ESPN broadcast energy

**Panels 2-4 feel... flat.** Here's why:

#### 1. Copy Doesn't Feel Cuban
- "You've been waiting for this" could be any event. No soul.
- "SO HAVE THEY" — who? The transition is unclear.
- "Make Them PROUD" — generic motivational poster energy

**What works elsewhere:** "La Salida," "La Ley," "Que Bola Asere," "La mesa te espera" — the Spanish GROUNDS it in culture.

#### 2. No Chapter Card Framing
Wes Anderson would frame these as title cards. Right now:
- Text floats without composition
- No badge, no frame, no intentional symmetry
- Doesn't feel like "Chapter 2" of the story

#### 3. Typography Lacks Hierarchy
The hero has: Badge → Title → Tagline → Subtitle (4 levels)
Panels 2-4 have: Greeting → Line (2 levels, both similar weight)

#### 4. The Transitions Don't Build
- Panel 2 → 3: Jarring. No callback, no thread.
- Panel 3 → 4: "SO HAVE THEY" → "Make Them PROUD" — the "they/them" connection is lost because Panel 3 doesn't name the ancestors.

---

### Creative Analysis

**George Lois:** "The copy doesn't SCREAM. 'You've been waiting' whispers. The image screams — man with cigar staring you down. MATCH THE ENERGY."

**Wes Anderson:** "Where's the frame? Each panel should feel like a chapter card in a film. I see no composition — just text on a photo."

**Tobias van Schneider:** "No depth. The hero has layers — badge, title, subtitle, tagline. These panels have one line floating. Where's the architecture?"

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "'You've been waiting for this' fails the Abuela Test. My grandmother wouldn't recognize this as Cuban. Where's the SOUL?"

**Wifredo Lam:** "The ancestors need to be NAMED. 'SO HAVE THEY' — who? Say it: your grandfather. The kitchen table. Sunday afternoons. Make it REAL."

---

### What Would Make It Magical

#### Option A: Lean Into Spanish Ritual
Use Spanish titles like the rest of the site:

| Panel | Title Card | Body |
|-------|------------|------|
| 2 | *La Bienvenida* | "Que Bola Asere" |
| 3 | *La Sangre* | "This game is in your blood." |
| 4 | *El Honor* | "Make them proud." |

**Wes Anderson:** "Now it's a triptych. Three chapters. La Bienvenida, La Sangre, El Honor."

#### Option B: Name the Ancestors
Make the heritage explicit:

| Panel | Copy |
|-------|------|
| 2 | "Que Bola Asere" / "Your grandfather played this game." |
| 3 | "Your grandmother watched." / "Now it's your turn." |
| 4 | "Make / Them / PROUD" |

**Daisy:** "NOW I feel something. 'Your grandfather played.' That's the kitchen table. That's real."

#### Option C: Chapter Card Structure (Wes Anderson)
Frame each panel as a film chapter:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│         CDL 1           │  ← Badge (consistent)
├─────────────────────────┤
│     La Bienvenida       │  ← Chapter title (Spanish)
│    ─────────────────    │  ← Divider
│   "Que Bola Asere"      │  ← The line
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Wes Anderson:** "Every panel should have the CDL 1 badge. It's the chapter marker. Symmetry. Consistency. This is how you build a world."

---

### Typography Direction (Tobias)

**Current problem:** All text is Bodoni italic at similar sizes. No architecture.

**Proposed hierarchy:**
1. **Badge** — CDL 1 domino tile (top, small, anchors the frame)
2. **Chapter Title** — Bodoni 900, Spanish, large (La Bienvenida)
3. **The Line** — Bodoni italic, medium, the emotional payload
4. **Context** — IBM Plex, small, grounding details

**Tobias:** "The hero works because it has FOUR levels of hierarchy. Give these panels the same architecture."

---

### Animation Direction

**Current:** Text fades in. Generic.

**Proposed:**
- Panel 2: Greeting smoke-reveals → pause → Line SLAMS (like a domino)
- Panel 3: Word emerges from darkness like memory surfacing
- Panel 4: Staggered build → Final word HITS with weight + glow

**Dana White:** "Panel 4 should feel like a knockout. The word PROUD needs to land like a punch."

---

### Open Questions

1. **Which direction?** Spanish chapter cards (A), Named ancestors (B), or both (C)?
2. **Should every panel have the CDL 1 badge?** (Wes says yes)
3. **How much Spanish is too much?** Balance accessibility with authenticity
4. **What's THE line for each panel?** The one thing you remember

---

### Next Steps

- [ ] Decide on copy direction
- [ ] Design chapter card frame structure
- [ ] Implement typography hierarchy (4 levels)
- [ ] Refine animations to match "domino slam" energy
- [ ] Test on mobile (99% of users)

---

## Session 2: Cuban Lingo Integration + Persona Testing

**Time:** Later that day
**Data Added:** Cuban Dominoes Lingo doc, Player Personas

---

### Key Cultural Insight

The site uses Cuban beautifully elsewhere:
- Hero: **"La Salida"** (the opening tile)
- Rules: **"La Ley"** (the law)
- Ticker: **"La Mesa"** (the table)

**Panels 2-4 speak English when they should speak Cuban.**

---

### Relevant Lingo for Copy

| Phrase | Meaning | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| "La ficha" | The tile | "Every ficha led here" |
| "Dale agua" | Shuffle tiles | Ritual beginning |
| "Me pegué" | I won | Victory moment |
| "Hablar mierda" | Trash talk | Social energy |

---

### Four Copy Options Developed

| Option | Panel 2 | Panel 3 | Panel 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| **1: La Ficha** | "Every ficha you've ever played led here." | "From your grandfather's hands to yours." | "Now make them count." |
| **2: La Mesa** | "You know this table." | "Your abuelo sat here. Your tío. Your father." | "Now it's your turn." |
| **3: El Momento** | "You've been shuffling these bones your whole life." | "Every Sunday. Every holiday. Every borrowed table." | "Tonight, the table is YOURS." |
| **4: La Sangre** | "This game is in your blood." | "Your grandfather knew it. Your grandmother watched." | "Make them proud." |

---

### Persona Test Results

| Option | Landy (OG) | Maria Elena (Keeper) | Danny (Competitor) | Carmen (Connector) | Alex (NJ) | Gaby (Miami) | **AVG** |
|--------|------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| 1: La Ficha | 6 | 5 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 5 | **5.5** |
| 2: La Mesa | 9 | 10 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 9 | **8.7** ⭐ |
| 3: El Momento | 8 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 8 | **8.2** ⭐ |
| 4: La Sangre | 6 | 8 | 5 | 6 | 6 | 5 | **6.0** |

**Winners:** Option 2 (La Mesa) and Option 3 (El Momento)

---

### Persona Quotes

**Landy on Option 2:** "Now you're talking. That's the kitchen table."

**Maria Elena on Option 2:** *tears up* "That's my grandfather."

**Carmen on Option 3:** "Borrowed table! That's specific. That's TRUE."

**Danny on Option 3:** "'Tonight the table is yours' — competitive. I'm in."

---

### Random Audience Test (Non-Cuban)

**Option 2** ("Your abuelo sat here"):
- Resonates emotionally
- Some Spanish creates slight barrier
- Clearly heritage-focused

**Option 3** ("Every Sunday. Every holiday."):
- More universally accessible
- "Borrowed table" is specific and relatable
- "Tonight it's yours" is a clear payoff

---

### Final Recommendation: Hybrid

| Panel | Copy |
|-------|------|
| **2** | *"Que Bola Asere"* / "You know this table." |
| **3** | "Your abuelo sat here." / "Every Sunday. Every holiday." |
| **4** | "Tonight, it's yours." |

**Why:**
- **Panel 2:** Insider language. Direct. "You KNOW this."
- **Panel 3:** Specific (abuelo) AND universal (Sundays, holidays)
- **Panel 4:** Short. Powerful. The ownership moment.

---

### Typography + Animation Direction

**Panel 2:**
- "Que Bola Asere" — smoke reveal, top letterbox
- "You know this table." — slam from below, centered, Bodoni italic

**Panel 3:**
- "Your abuelo sat here." — fade in, brass glow
- "Every Sunday. Every holiday." — staggered reveal, smaller

**Panel 4:**
- "Tonight," — build
- "it's yours." — SLAM with glow, massive

---

### Action Items

- [x] Test copy with personas
- [x] Test with non-Cuban audience
- [x] **IMPLEMENT:** Hybrid copy (Option 2 + 3) — DONE Jan 16
- [ ] Add chapter card framing (CDL 1 badge on each panel?)
- [ ] Refine typography hierarchy
- [x] Test on mobile (responsive clamp values added)

---

## Implementation: January 16, 2026

### Final Copy Deployed

| Panel | Copy |
|-------|------|
| **2** | *"Que Bola Asere"* / **"You know this table."** |
| **3** | **"Your abuelo sat here."** / *"Every Sunday. Every holiday."* |
| **4** | **"Claim Your SEAT"** |

### The Thread

**Table → Seat → Table waiting**
- Panel 2: "You know this **table**."
- Panel 3: "Your abuelo **sat** here."
- Panel 4: "Claim Your **SEAT**."
- Tagline: "La **mesa** te espera."

Perfect harmony with brand language.

### Typography Treatment

**Panel 3:**
- Primary line: "Your abuelo sat here." — Bodoni italic, white, warm glow
- Secondary line: "Every Sunday. Every holiday." — Smaller, brass color, supporting

**Panel 4:**
- "Claim" → "Your" → "SEAT" — Staggered build, final word massive with glow

# Revision: January 17, 2026
## Lin-Manuel Miranda Interview — Lyrical Polish for Panels 2-4

**New Team Member:** Lin-Manuel Miranda (Lyricist / Copy Poet)
**Focus:** Final emotional refinement for the heart of CDL

---

### Why Lin-Manuel

**Heritage:** Puerto Rican — Caribbean diaspora, intimately knows this story

**Relevant Work:**
- "In the Heights" — community, abuela's wisdom, inherited dreams
- "Hamilton" — legacy, "who lives, who dies, who tells your story"
- "Moana" — ancestors calling you forward

**Superpower:** Taking massive emotional truths and distilling them to the ONE line that lands in the chest.

---

### The Interview

Full transcript: `TEAM/INTERVIEWS/interview-lin-manuel-miranda-lyricist.md`

Key questions explored:
1. Does "Some tables never forget" work as the opening?
2. Is "know" the right verb for recognition?
3. Does "abuelo" carry enough weight?
4. Is "ficha" the right cultural word for the torch pass?
5. Does "Claim Your SEAT" close the loop?
6. What's the ONE line that makes this LAND?

---

### Copy Changes Implemented

| Panel | Before | After | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **2 Setup** | "Some tables never forget." | "This table remembers." | Active > passive. Table is alive NOW. |
| **2 Recognition** | "You know this table." | "You've sat here before." | Body memory > intellectual knowing |
| **3 Heritage** | "Every weekend. Every holiday." | "Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye." | Life cycle in seven words (routine → celebration → loss) |
| **3 Torch Pass** | "Now the ficha passes to you." | "Now the ficha is yours." | Singular tile = singular torch. Cuban language. |
| **4 CTA** | "CLAIM YOUR SEAT" | "TAKE YOUR SEAT" | Homecoming > conquest |

---

### Lin-Manuel's Key Insights

1. **Active language:** "Remembers" does something. "Never forget" describes.

2. **Body memory:** "You've sat here before" — the memory is in your body, not your brain.

3. **Life cycle punch:** "Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye." — routine, celebration, loss in seven words.

4. **Cuban language:** "Now the ficha is yours" — singular tile, singular torch. Your turn.

5. **Homecoming over conquest:** "Take" = it was always yours. "Claim" = you're taking what wasn't.

6. **Silence matters:** Build pauses into animation timing. The words that matter need room to BREATHE.

---

### The Complete Arc (Final)

> **Panel 2:** "This table remembers." → "Que Bola Asere" → "You've sat here before."
>
> **Panel 3:** "Your abuelo sat here." → "Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye." → "Now the ficha is yours."
>
> **Panel 4:** "TAKE YOUR SEAT" → "La mesa te espera."

**The Thread:** Table remembers → You've sat here → Abuelo sat here → Ficha is yours → Take your seat → Table waits

---

### Team Sign-off

**Lin-Manuel Miranda:** "The life cycle line will make people cry. That's the one."

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "Quinceañera. That's specific Cuban. That passes the abuela test."

**George Lois:** "'Now the ficha is yours' — short, Cuban, ownership. That's not marketing, that's TRUTH."

**Wes Anderson:** "The arc builds correctly now. Recognition → Weight → Action. Classic three-act."

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

# Revision: January 17, 2026 (Session 2)
## Visual Storytelling Cohesion — Shadow Hierarchy + Panel 2 Voice Analysis

**Creative Lead:** Tobias van Schneider + Lin-Manuel Miranda
**Focus:** Making visual weight match narrative arc; fixing Panel 2's "two speakers, one voice" problem

---

### The Shadow Hierarchy Problem

**Tobias van Schneider:** "I'm looking at the full scroll. La Salida in Panel 1 has 7 layers of text-shadow. SEAT in Panel 4 has 4. The opening is outshining the climax. That's backwards."

**The Fix:**

| Element | Before | After | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| La Salida (Panel 1) | 7 shadow layers | 4 layers | Hero shouldn't outshine climax |
| SEAT (Panel 4) | 4 shadow layers | 6 layers | THE climax moment needs weight |
| Slam context | 100% cream | 65% cream | Context recedes, doesn't compete |
| Torch text | 100% brass | 75% brass | Signature whispers, doesn't shout |

**Tobias:** "Now the visual weight builds: Hero (4) → Build (moderate) → Climax (6). The eye knows where the money shot is."

---

### Panel 2: The Two Voices Problem

**The Screenshots:**
1. "This table remembers." appears first (0.3s)
2. "Que Bola Asere" appears second (2.0s)
3. "You've sat here before." appears last (3.8s)

**Lin-Manuel Miranda:** "Wait. Look at these two lines. They're both brass. They're both italic. But they're not the same SPEAKER."

| Line | Who's Speaking | What It Should Feel Like |
|------|---------------|--------------------------|
| "This table remembers." | The ROOM | Ethereal, ghostly, omniscient narrator |
| "Que Bola Asere" | A PERSON | Warm, direct, someone greeting you |
| "You've sat here before." | Recognition | Full presence, the moment lands |

**Tobias:** "Same color = same voice. You're telling me the room and the person sound identical? No. The room should feel like a memory. The person should feel like warmth."

**Lin-Manuel:** "In musicals, the narrator is usually a different instrument. Softer. More distant. Then the character comes in FULL. That's the contrast."

---

### The Color Differentiation Solution

**Current (broken):**
- "This table remembers." → brass @ 85%
- "Que Bola Asere" → brass @ 100%

**Proposed (fixed):**
- "This table remembers." → **cream @ 50%** (ghostly, memory, the room itself)
- "Que Bola Asere" → brass @ 100% (warm, human, someone speaking TO you)
- "You've sat here before." → white (full presence, payoff)

**Lin-Manuel:** "Now you have three distinct voices:
1. **Ghost** (50% cream) — the room whispers its history
2. **Human** (100% brass) — someone greets you warmly
3. **Realization** (100% white) — you understand where you are"

**Tobias:** "That's a cinematic color grade. Cool to warm to bright. The emotional temperature rises."

---

### The Timing Gap Problem

**Current delays:**
```
0.3s  → "This table remembers."
2.0s  → "Que Bola Asere"
3.8s  → "You've sat here before."
```

**Lin-Manuel:** "That's a 1.8 second gap between the greeting and the payoff. Dead air. You'll lose them."

**Proposed tighter timing:**
```
0.3s  → "This table remembers." (room whispers)
1.6s  → "Que Bola Asere" (you're greeted)
2.8s  → "You've sat here before." (recognition lands)
```

**Lin-Manuel:** "Silence is powerful, but only when EARNED. After a big revelation, pause. After a greeting? Move to the point."

---

### Animation Duration Normalization

**Tobias flagged another issue:**

**Before (accelerating — feels rushed):**
- whisper-greeting: 1.8s duration
- whisper-setup: 1.5s duration
- whisper-line--mystery: 1.4s duration

**After (consistent — cinematic rhythm):**
- All three: **1.6s duration**

**Tobias:** "The decreasing durations created subliminal anxiety. Like a film editor cutting faster and faster for no reason. Consistent timing = confident storytelling."

---

### The Complete Panel 2 Arc (Proposed)

| Time | Element | Color | Voice | Animation |
|------|---------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 0.3s | "This table remembers." | cream 50% | Narrator (room) | Soft fade, ghostly |
| 1.6s | "Que Bola Asere" | brass 100% | Character (human) | Warm smoke reveal |
| 2.8s | "You've sat here before." | white 100% | Recognition (payoff) | Lands with weight |

**Lin-Manuel:** "Now it's a scene:
1. You enter a room. The room itself seems to whisper.
2. Someone looks up and greets you warmly.
3. You realize: you've been here before. This is home."

---

### Team Sign-off

**Tobias van Schneider:** "The shadow hierarchy now builds to climax. The color differentiation creates distinct voices. The timing is tighter. This passes the 'room' test — it feels like a PLACE, not a slideshow."

**Lin-Manuel Miranda:** "Three voices, three colors, three beats. That's musical structure. Setup, complication, resolution. The room whispers, a friend greets, you remember. Perfect."

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "The ghostly cream for 'This table remembers' — that's ancestors. That's not a person talking. That's the PLACE remembering. Yes."

---

### Action Items

- [ ] Change `.whisper-setup` color from `rgba(212, 165, 116, 0.85)` to `rgba(248, 239, 230, 0.50)` (cream 50%)
- [ ] Tighten animation delays: 0.3s → 1.6s → 2.8s
- [ ] Keep `.whisper-greeting` at brass 100% (warm human voice)
- [ ] Verify shadow hierarchy: Panel 1 (4 layers) < Panel 4 (6 layers)
- [ ] Test full scroll — visual weight should BUILD to climax

---

### The Narrative Voice Principle (New Rule)

> **Different speakers need different colors.**
>
> - **Narrator/Room** = cool, ethereal (cream at low opacity)
> - **Character/Human** = warm, present (brass at full)
> - **Revelation/Payoff** = bright, full presence (white)
>
> If two lines are the same color, they're the same voice.

# Revision: January 19, 2026
## Panel 3 Animation Timing — "Let the Ancestors Land"

**Creative Lead:** Lin-Manuel Miranda
**Focus:** Panel 3 had the same overlapping problem as Panel 2 & 4 (now fixed). The torch pass ("Te toca.") was competing with the lifecycle line instead of emerging from SILENCE.

---

### Lin-Manuel's Principle

> "Silence isn't empty. It's where the feeling lives."

The torch pass moment ("Te toca.") must emerge from SILENCE after the life cycle sinks in.

---

### The Problem (Before)

```
CURRENT TIMELINE (RUSHED):

0.2s  "Your abuelo sat here."     [2.2s] ──→ 2.4s
1.5s  "Your tío. Your father."    [1.0s] ──→ 2.5s   ← STARTS BEFORE ABUELO LANDS!
2.5s  "Every Sunday..."           [1.5s] ──→ 4.0s   ← ZERO BREATH
3.5s  "Te toca."                  [2.0s] ──→ 5.5s   ← STARTS BEFORE LIFECYCLE LANDS!
5.0s  Scroll hint                                   ← APPEARS BEFORE TORCH LANDS!

Scroll lock: 5500ms (5.5s)
```

**Problem:** Every element steps on the previous one. "Te toca." should be THE moment — but it was competing with the lifecycle line.

---

### The Solution (After)

```
NEW TIMELINE — "LET THE ANCESTORS LAND":

0.3s  "Your abuelo sat here."     [2.2s] ──→ 2.5s
           ↓ 0.5s SILENCE (ancestor lands)
3.0s  "Your tío. Your father."    [1.0s] ──→ 4.0s
           ↓ 0.8s SILENCE (generations settle)
4.8s  "Every Sunday..."           [1.5s] ──→ 6.3s
           ↓ 1.2s SILENCE (life cycle absorbs — THE BREATH)
7.5s  "Te toca."                  [2.0s] ──→ 9.5s
           ↓ 0.5s SILENCE (torch reverberates)
10.0s Scroll hint fades in

Scroll lock: 10500ms (10.5s)
```

---

### CSS Changes Summary

| Element | CSS Class | Before | After | Change |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Primary (abuelo) | `.build-word--primary` | 0.2s | 0.3s | +0.1s |
| Generations | `.build-family__line--generations` | 1.5s | 3.0s | +1.5s (wait for abuelo to land) |
| Lifecycle | `.build-lifecycle__line` | 2.5s | 4.8s | +2.3s (0.8s silence after generations) |
| Torch ("Te toca.") | `.build-word--torch` | 3.5s | 7.5s | +4.0s (1.2s THE BREATH) |
| Scroll hint | `.build-scroll-hint` | 5.0s | 10.0s | +5.0s |
| **Scroll lock** | `lockScroll()` | 5500ms | 10500ms | +5000ms |

**Total sequence:** 5.5s → 10.5s (+5.0s of meaningful silence)

---

### The Breathing Room Principle

> **Every element needs room to land.**
>
> - Don't start the next element until the previous one FULLY completes
> - Add SILENCE between elements (0.5s–1.2s depending on emotional weight)
> - The most important moment (torch pass) needs the LONGEST pause before it
> - Scroll hint waits until everything reverberates

This principle was already applied to Panels 2 & 4. Now Panel 3 matches.

---

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] **Abuelo check:** Does "Your abuelo sat here" land fully before generations appear?
- [ ] **Lifecycle check:** Does "Every Sunday..." have room to absorb before "Te toca."?
- [ ] **Torch check:** Does "Te toca." emerge from SILENCE? Does it feel like a torch being passed?
- [ ] **Lin-Manuel test:** "Is there silence where the feeling lives?"

---

### Team Sign-off

**Lin-Manuel Miranda:** "Now the torch pass has WEIGHT. You feel the generations before you feel the responsibility. That 1.2s silence before 'Te toca.' is where the goosebumps live."

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
