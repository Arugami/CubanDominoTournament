## Panel-by-Panel Review

### Panel 1: Hero (The Invitation)

**Current Copy:**
```
Cuban Domino League
presents
Tournament I
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
[Enter]
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Jay-Z:** Brand hierarchy is correct. CDL is the empire, Tournament I is the chapter.

**Wes Anderson:** "Tournament I" with the golden numeral feels like a chapter card. Exactly right.

**Dana White:** Clean. Gets people curious. The "Enter" button is like walking through a door.

**George Lois:** This is the hook. It INVITES. Don't overthink it.

**Daisy:** Date and venue here is good - people need to know the basics immediately.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - No changes needed

---

### Panel 2: The Greeting

**Current Copy:**
```
Que Bola Asere
We've been expecting you.
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Que Bola Asere" - this passes the abuela test. Real Cuban greeting. Not forced. Perfect.

**George Lois:** "We've been expecting you" - confident, welcoming, slightly ominous. You SCREAM welcome but with an edge.

**Wifredo Lam:** The man with the cigar IS the ancestors welcoming you. The copy matches.

**Capablanca:** This sets the tone - you're entering a world with history and respect.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 3: The Tension

**Final Copy:**
```
You didn't learn this game.
You inherited it!
```

**Image Context:** Man at domino table, intense expression, game is getting heated. This is the moment before everything explodes.

**Team Discussion:**

**George Lois:** "If you can't say it in one breath, it's too much. This panel is about TENSION. Keep it tight."

**Daisy:** "Everyone learned at the kitchen table - abuelos, tíos, Sunday afternoons. Now there's finally a stage for it. THAT'S the emotional truth. 'You inherited it' captures that perfectly."

**Wifredo Lam:** "The bones remember. Your grandfather played. This copy honors the ancestors."

**Dana White:** "The exclamation point adds the energy. This is a statement of PRIDE."

**Why This Works:**
- Short enough to read in one breath ✓
- Captures the heritage/family angle ✓
- Matches the intensity of the image ✓
- Exclamation point adds energy for the tension moment ✓

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 4: The Climax

**Current Copy:**
```
Winning Team Takes All
Are you ready?
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** "WINNING TEAM" - yes. This is about partnership. Two people. That's what makes dominoes different from poker.

**Jay-Z:** High stakes. Clear. "Takes All" is the promise.

**George Lois:** "Are you ready?" - direct challenge. No fluff. Perfect for the table-flip energy.

**Benny Binion:** This is single elimination energy. One shot. Everything on the line.

**Capablanca:** The table flip image shows passion - Cubans FEEL this game. The copy should match that fire.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 5: Registration Form

**Current Copy:**
```
Join The League
Tournament I • Limited to 10 Teams

[X] teams in | [X] spots left
Be one of the first 10 to play

- Two players per team
- Pay $50 on arrival
- Play to 150
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** The counter creates FOMO. "6 spots left" - that's urgency.

**Jay-Z:** "Join The League" - you're not just registering, you're becoming part of something.

**Benny Binion:** Logistics are clear. $50, two players, play to 150. No confusion.

**Daisy:** "Be one of the first 10 to play" - this is history-making language. Good.

**George Lois:** Form copy doesn't need to scream. It needs to be clear. This works.

**Wes Anderson:** The progression from dramatic panels to a clean form feels like the story resolving.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Success Screen

**Current Copy:**
```
Your Team's In.
Check your email for confirmation details

January 31, 2025
Mr Garcia Cigars
Doors open at 6PM

"Your seat's waiting."

Questions? Erik@cubandominoleague.com
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Your Team's In" - team focus. You're not alone. You registered WITH someone. Good.

**Jay-Z:** "Your seat's waiting" as the closer ties back to the brand tagline. Cohesive.

**Capablanca:** Practical details here make sense - they need to know when to arrive.

**Wifredo Lam:** The domino animation on success feels like a celebration. The bones welcome you.

**George Lois:** Clean confirmation. Not the place to oversell. Just say "you're in" and shut up.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

## Creative Principles (George Lois)

1. **"You don't whisper. You SCREAM. But you scream something true."**
2. **"Sell the MOMENT, not the game."**
3. **"If you can't say it in one breath, it's too much."**
4. **Images you can HEAR** - the slam, the tension, the celebration

---

## Authenticity Check (Daisy Expósito-Ulla)

All copy must pass the **Abuela Test:**
- Would your Cuban grandmother recognize this?
- Does it feel authentic or forced?
- Is it rooted in real culture, not stereotypes?

**Results:**
- "Que Bola Asere" ✅
- "Your seat's waiting" ✅
- "Your Team's In" ✅

---

## Action Items

# Revision: January 15, 2026
## Panel 2 Copy Overhaul — Visual Energy Mismatch

**Creative Lead:** George Lois + Dana White
**Focus:** Panel 2 copy didn't match the UFC staredown energy of frame-2.webp

---

### The Problem

After reviewing the actual background images:

| Frame | Visual Energy | Original Copy | Issue |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| frame-2.webp | Man staring down camera, cigar raised, UFC weigh-in energy | "We've been expecting you..." | **TOO SOFT** |

**George Lois:** "You don't whisper when the image is SCREAMING at you. The man in that photo is challenging you. The copy should match."

**Dana White:** "That's a fighter sizing you up. 'We've been expecting you' sounds like a hotel concierge, not a competitor."

---

### Panel Structure Clarification

The actual site has 6 panels, not 5:

| Panel | Name | Background | Content |
|-------|------|------------|---------|
| 1 | Hero | frame-hero.webp | "La Salida" |
| 2 | Whisper | frame-2.webp | Greeting + Challenge |
| 3 | Build | frame-3.webp | "INHERITED" revelation |
| 4 | Slam | frame-4.webp | "Winner Takes All" |
| 5 | Rules | *(no image)* | "La Ley" + rules grid |
| 6 | Form | gradient | Registration |

---

### Panel 2: Revised Copy

**Before:**
```
Que Bola Asere
We've been watching you...
...train
...learn
...wait.
```

**After:**
```
Que Bola Asere
You think you learned this game?
We know better.
We know who you are.
```

**Why the change:**

1. **Challenge matches image:** The man is staring you down. "You think you learned?" is a direct challenge that matches his posture.

2. **Sets up Panel 3:** "You think you learned" → "You didn't learn this game. It was INHERITED." The callback makes the revelation land harder.

3. **Cuban + UFC balance:** "Que Bola Asere" keeps the Cuban soul. The challenge adds Dana White's competitive edge.

---

### Story Flow: Panels 2→3→4

> **Panel 2:** "Que Bola Asere. You think you learned this game? We know better. We know who you are."
>
> **Panel 3:** "You didn't learn this game. It was INHERITED."
>
> **Panel 4:** "Winner Takes All"

**George Lois:** "Now THAT reads like a movie trailer. Challenge → Revelation → Stakes. Each panel builds."

---

### Typography & Animation Changes

**Typography treatment:**
- Challenge line: Upright (not italic), bolder — confrontational
- Counter line ("We know better."): Brass color, snap animation — punchy like a jab
- Mystery line: Italic, glow effect — lingers before INHERITED

**Animation timing:**
- Total sequence: ~5.5s (was ~7s with 4 lines)
- Counter has "snap" overshoot animation
- Mystery line gets subtle glow at end

---

### Team Sign-off

**Dana White:** "NOW it matches the image. That's a staredown."

**George Lois:** "Challenge in, softness out. This passes."

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "Still passes the Abuela test. 'Que Bola Asere' anchors it in Cuban culture."

**Jay-Z:** "The mystery line 'We know who you are' is exclusive energy. You belong here because of your bloodline."

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Updated Summary

| Panel | Original Copy | Revised Copy | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 2 (Whisper) | "We've been expecting you..." | "You think you learned this game? We know better. We know who you are." | ✅ Updated Jan 15 |
| 3 (Build) | "INHERITED" | *(no change)* | ✅ |
| 4 (Slam) | "Winner Takes All" | *(no change)* | ✅ |
| 5 (Rules) | "La Ley" | *(no change)* | ✅ |
