## Panel-by-Panel Review

### Panel 1: Hero (The Invitation)

**Current Copy:**
```
Cuban Domino League
presents
Tournament I
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
[Enter]
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Jay-Z:** Brand hierarchy is correct. CDL is the empire, Tournament I is the chapter.

**Wes Anderson:** "Tournament I" with the golden numeral feels like a chapter card. Exactly right.

**Dana White:** Clean. Gets people curious. The "Enter" button is like walking through a door.

**George Lois:** This is the hook. It INVITES. Don't overthink it.

**Daisy:** Date and venue here is good - people need to know the basics immediately.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED - No changes needed

---

### Panel 2: The Greeting

**Current Copy:**
```
Que Bola Asere
We've been expecting you.
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Que Bola Asere" - this passes the abuela test. Real Cuban greeting. Not forced. Perfect.

**George Lois:** "We've been expecting you" - confident, welcoming, slightly ominous. You SCREAM welcome but with an edge.

**Wifredo Lam:** The man with the cigar IS the ancestors welcoming you. The copy matches.

**Capablanca:** This sets the tone - you're entering a world with history and respect.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 3: The Tension

**Final Copy:**
```
You didn't learn this game.
You inherited it!
```

**Image Context:** Man at domino table, intense expression, game is getting heated. This is the moment before everything explodes.

**Team Discussion:**

**George Lois:** "If you can't say it in one breath, it's too much. This panel is about TENSION. Keep it tight."

**Daisy:** "Everyone learned at the kitchen table - abuelos, tíos, Sunday afternoons. Now there's finally a stage for it. THAT'S the emotional truth. 'You inherited it' captures that perfectly."

**Wifredo Lam:** "The bones remember. Your grandfather played. This copy honors the ancestors."

**Dana White:** "The exclamation point adds the energy. This is a statement of PRIDE."

**Why This Works:**
- Short enough to read in one breath ✓
- Captures the heritage/family angle ✓
- Matches the intensity of the image ✓
- Exclamation point adds energy for the tension moment ✓

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 4: The Climax

**Current Copy:**
```
Winning Team Takes All
Are you ready?
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** "WINNING TEAM" - yes. This is about partnership. Two people. That's what makes dominoes different from poker.

**Jay-Z:** High stakes. Clear. "Takes All" is the promise.

**George Lois:** "Are you ready?" - direct challenge. No fluff. Perfect for the table-flip energy.

**Benny Binion:** This is single elimination energy. One shot. Everything on the line.

**Capablanca:** The table flip image shows passion - Cubans FEEL this game. The copy should match that fire.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Panel 5: Registration Form

**Current Copy:**
```
Join The League
Tournament I • Limited to 10 Teams

[X] teams in | [X] spots left
Be one of the first 10 to play

- Two players per team
- Pay $50 on arrival
- Play to 150
```

**Team Discussion:**

**Dana White:** The counter creates FOMO. "6 spots left" - that's urgency.

**Jay-Z:** "Join The League" - you're not just registering, you're becoming part of something.

**Benny Binion:** Logistics are clear. $50, two players, play to 150. No confusion.

**Daisy:** "Be one of the first 10 to play" - this is history-making language. Good.

**George Lois:** Form copy doesn't need to scream. It needs to be clear. This works.

**Wes Anderson:** The progression from dramatic panels to a clean form feels like the story resolving.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

### Success Screen

**Current Copy:**
```

Check your email for confirmation details

January 31, 2025

"Your seat's waiting."

```

**Team Discussion:**

**Daisy:** "Your Team's In" - team focus. You're not alone. You registered WITH someone. Good.

**Jay-Z:** "Your seat's waiting" as the closer ties back to the brand tagline. Cohesive.

**Capablanca:** Practical details here make sense - they need to know when to arrive.

**Wifredo Lam:** The domino animation on success feels like a celebration. The bones welcome you.

**George Lois:** Clean confirmation. Not the place to oversell. Just say "you're in" and shut up.

**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

## Creative Principles (George Lois)

1. **"You don't whisper. You SCREAM. But you scream something true."**
2. **"Sell the MOMENT, not the game."**
3. **"If you can't say it in one breath, it's too much."**
4. **Images you can HEAR** - the slam, the tension, the celebration

---

## Authenticity Check (Daisy Expósito-Ulla)

All copy must pass the **Abuela Test:**
- Would your Cuban grandmother recognize this?
- Does it feel authentic or forced?
- Is it rooted in real culture, not stereotypes?

**Results:**
- "Que Bola Asere" ✅
- "Your seat's waiting" ✅
- "Your Team's In" ✅
