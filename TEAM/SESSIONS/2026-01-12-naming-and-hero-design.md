## Agenda Item 1: Tournament Naming — "CDL:1 La Salida"

### The Proposal

Name the first tournament **"CDL:1 La Salida"** following the UFC model:
- UFC 1, UFC 2, UFC 3...
- CDL:1, CDL:2, CDL:3...

Each tournament gets a subtitle:
- **La Salida** = "The Opening" / "The First Move" (domino term for who plays first)

### Team Discussion

**Dana White:** This is EXACTLY what we did with UFC. UFC 1 was "The Beginning." You need that numbering system—it creates history. Five years from now, people will say "I was at CDL:1." The colon makes it feel like a title card. I love it.

**Jay-Z:** The numbering is smart branding. It's collectible. CDL:1 becomes a moment in time. But I want to talk about balance—you don't want "CDL" to overshadow the event name. "La Salida" should be the star. CDL is the studio, La Salida is the film.

**Herb Lubalin:** From a typography standpoint, "CDL:1" is a gift. Three letters, a colon, a number. It's compact, it's bold, it stacks beautifully. But Jay is right—on the hero, "La Salida" should be the dominant element. The CDL:1 can live smaller, as a chapter marker.

**George Lois:** "La Salida"—that's your headline. It sounds like a place you want to be. It sounds like an EVENT. "CDL:1" is the fine print. Nobody remembers "UFC 1"—they remember "The Ultimate Fighting Championship." But the number creates legacy. Use both, but know which one sells.

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** "La Salida" passes the abuela test. It's real domino language. When someone has salida, they control the game. Calling this tournament "La Salida" says we're setting the tone for everything that comes after. That's powerful.

**Capablanca:** In chess, we speak of "the opening" with reverence. Entire books written about those first moves. "La Salida" carries that weight—the first move determines everything. This is not just a name, it is a statement of intent.

**Wifredo Lam:** The bones remember who has salida. To name the first tournament after the first move... the ancestors approve. This connects us to generations of players who understood that beginnings matter.

**Wes Anderson:** I see it as chapter structure. "CDL:1" is the chapter number in the corner. "La Salida" is the chapter title in elegant script. Think of it like a Wes Anderson title card—the functional and the beautiful together.

### Decision

**✅ APPROVED: CDL:1 La Salida**

- Tournament naming convention: CDL:[number] [Subtitle]
- First tournament: **CDL:1 La Salida**
- Future examples: CDL:2 [TBD], CDL:3 [TBD]

## Agenda Item 2: Hero Page Design Hierarchy

### The Challenge

Original hero had:
```
Cuban Domino League
presents
CDL:1
La Salida
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
```

**Problem identified:** "Cuban Domino League presents CDL" is redundant (CDL = Cuban Domino League).

### Current Implementation

```
CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE
presents

La Salida

The First Cuban Domino League Tournament
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
```

### Team Discussion

**Erik:** I think the spaced letterspacing on "CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE" looks super premium. It fits the brand. But the CDL redundancy was bothering me. What if we lead with "La Salida" as the star?

**Herb Lubalin:** This hierarchy is correct. "Cuban Domino League presents" acts as a crown—it's the presenter credit, like "Marvel Studios presents." Then the event name takes center stage. No redundancy because we're not saying "CDL" again.

**Jay-Z:** This is how movie posters work. Studio at top, small. Title in the middle, huge. Details at the bottom. You've got the hierarchy right. The league presents the event—the event is what people are coming to see.

**George Lois:** "La Salida" in that script font—THAT'S your hero. Everything else is supporting. The brass letterspacing on "Cuban Domino League" whispers class. "La Salida" SCREAMS invitation. Good contrast.

**Wes Anderson:** I appreciate the layered information design. Crown → Title → Context → Details. It reads like a film poster or a chapter card. The tagline "The First Cuban Domino League Tournament" adds historical weight without cluttering the main title.

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** Putting "The First Cuban Domino League Tournament" as a tagline is smart. You're telling people this is historic without being heavy-handed. It creates FOMO. "First" is a powerful word.

**Dana White:** This is your origin story framing. UFC 1 was "Where It All Began." You're doing the same thing. "The First" makes everyone want to be part of history.

**Wifredo Lam:** The hierarchy feels ceremonial. An announcement, then the name, then the meaning, then the details. Like an invitation to something sacred. This is how you summon people to the table.

**Capablanca:** The structure has elegance. Clear. Direct. Nothing wasted. A champion's economy of words.

### Visual Hierarchy (Finalized)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│     C U B A N  D O M I N O  L E A G U E │  ← Spaced, gold, small
│              presents                    │  ← Italic, subtle
│                                         │
│           𝐿𝑎 𝒮𝒶𝓁𝒾𝒹𝒶                     │  ← Script, LARGE, hero
│                                         │
│   The First Cuban Domino League         │  ← Brass, tagline
│           Tournament                     │
│                                         │
│  January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars    │  ← Details, muted
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Decision

**✅ APPROVED: Current Hero Hierarchy**

- Remove "CDL:1" from visual hero (redundant)
- Keep "CDL:1" for tournament naming/branding elsewhere
- "La Salida" is the star
- "Cuban Domino League presents" stays as the crown
- "The First Cuban Domino League Tournament" as tagline

---

## Agenda Item 3: Where Does "CDL:1" Live?

### Discussion

**Erik:** If we're removing CDL:1 from the hero, where does it show up?

**Jay-Z:** Page title, meta tags, social shares. When someone shares the link, they see "CDL:1 La Salida." That numbering matters for searchability and legacy.

**Herb Lubalin:** Rules panel. Registration confirmations. Anywhere you need the official tournament identifier. The hero is for emotion—other places are for information.

**Dana White:** Merch. "CDL:1 La Salida" on a shirt. The colon-number format becomes a collector's item over time. "I was at CDL:1."

**Wes Anderson:** Chapter cards throughout the experience. When you submit registration: "Welcome to CDL:1." It can appear at functional moments without dominating the emotional hero.

**George Lois:** Save it for the places where people need to remember WHICH tournament. On the hero, they just need to feel something. "La Salida" is the feeling. "CDL:1" is the record.

### Decision

**CDL:1 appears in:**
- Page title: "La Salida | Cuban Domino League"
- Meta description
- Rules panel header
- Registration confirmation emails
- Merch and collectibles
- Social media handles/hashtags (#CDL1)
- Official tournament records

**CDL:1 does NOT appear in:**
- Hero visual (La Salida is the star)
- Main emotional touchpoints

## Agenda Item 4: "Tournament" vs "Event" vs "Championship"

*Added mid-session after reviewing UFC 1 reference*

### The Question

Erik pulled up UFC 1 on Google — it's labeled as an **"Event"** with subtitle "The Beginning." Current hero says:

```
The First Cuban Domino League Tournament
```

Should we say **Event** or **Championship** instead of **Tournament**?

### Team Discussion

**Dana White:** Look at how UFC did it. UFC 1 was called "The Ultimate Fighting Championship" — not "Tournament." The word "Championship" implies stakes. It implies a title. "Tournament" sounds like a bracket at a bar. We're building something bigger.

**Jay-Z:** "Event" is neutral but it works for UFC because they're selling spectacle. For us? I'd lean toward "Championship" — it has gravitas. But here's the thing: this IS a tournament format. Single elimination. So maybe we own that word but elevate it.

**George Lois:** "Championship" SOUNDS like something. "Tournament" sounds like you're playing cards with your cousins. But "Event" is too corporate. If we're paralleling UFC, they called themselves a CHAMPIONSHIP from day one. That confidence matters.

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** In the Cuban community, we say "el torneo" all the time. It's natural. But "Championship" adds prestige. What about "The First Cuban Domino Championship"? That sounds like something worth traveling for.

**Capablanca:** In chess, we have tournaments and we have championships. A championship crowns a CHAMPION. If the winner takes all and earns a title, this is a championship. If it's just for fun, it's a tournament. What is your intent?

**Herb Lubalin:** Typographically, "Championship" has more letters but more weight. It fills the space better. "Tournament" feels thin by comparison.

**Wes Anderson:** "Championship" feels like the right chapter title. "The First Cuban Domino League Championship" — that's a sentence with authority.

**Wifredo Lam:** Championships are remembered. Tournaments are forgotten. If the ancestors are watching, make it worthy of their attention.

### Options

| Option | Tagline |
|--------|---------|
| A | The First Cuban Domino League Tournament |
| B | The First Cuban Domino League Championship |
| C | The First Cuban Domino League Event |
| D | The First CDL Championship |

### Decision

**✅ APPROVED: Championship**

Erik's call: Go with "Championship" — parallels UFC's approach, adds gravitas.

Updated tagline: **"The First Cuban Domino League Championship"**

## Agenda Item 5: Double "Cuban Domino League" Problem

### The Issue

Current hero has "Cuban Domino League" appearing twice:

```
CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE        ← Here
presents

La Salida

The First Cuban Domino League Tournament   ← And here
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
```

### Options Proposed

**Option A:** Change tagline to use "CDL"
```
The First CDL Championship
```

**Option B:** Add CDL logo in top-left corner, simplify presenter text
```
[CDL LOGO top-left]

presents

La Salida

The First Championship
```

**Option C:** Keep double usage (it's reinforcement, not redundancy)

### Team Discussion

**Herb Lubalin:** This is a logo placement question. If we had the CDL mark in the corner — a proper brandmark — then "presents" could stand alone without spelling out the full name. The mark DOES the work. That's what logos are for.

**Jay-Z:** Roc-A-Fella logo in the corner, then just "presents." Clean. But you need the mark to be strong enough to carry that weight. Do we have a CDL logo that can do that?

**Dana White:** UFC has the octagon logo. It appears EVERYWHERE. If CDL has a mark, use it. Top-left corner, small but present. Then the tagline can just say "The First Championship" without repeating "Cuban Domino League."

**George Lois:** A logo in the corner is a signature. It says "we made this." Then you don't need to spell it out twice. But the logo has to be GOOD. A bad logo in the corner is worse than no logo.

**Wes Anderson:** I like the idea of a small emblem — perhaps the CDL letters stylized, or a domino mark. Top-left, like a film studio logo. Then the hierarchy becomes: Mark → "presents" → Event Name → Context.

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla:** If we use "CDL" in the tagline instead of "Cuban Domino League," we lose some of the heritage weight. "Cuban Domino League Championship" sounds more important than "CDL Championship." The abbreviation is convenient but less powerful.

**Wifredo Lam:** The full name carries the ancestors. "Cuban" — that word matters. Don't abbreviate the heritage.

**Capablanca:** The repetition is not redundant if the contexts are different. First instance: who presents. Second instance: what this is. Two different purposes.

### Options Breakdown

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **A: "The First CDL Championship"** | Shorter, avoids repetition | Loses "Cuban" weight in tagline |
| **B: CDL logo top-left** | Professional, clean hierarchy | Need a strong logo asset |
| **C: Keep double usage** | Full heritage, no new assets needed | Feels repetitive |
| **D: Hybrid — Logo + shortened tagline** | Best of both | Most work |

### Team Recommendation

**Option B or D** — If we have (or can create) a strong CDL brandmark, place it top-left. This allows:
- Logo carries brand identity
- "presents" becomes the transition
- Tagline can be simplified: "The First Championship" or keep full name

**Fallback (Option C):** If no logo is ready, the double usage is acceptable — Capablanca's point that they serve different purposes is valid.

### Decision

**✅ RESOLVED: No logo yet — Add to MASTERTODO**

Erik's call:
- No CDL logo exists yet
- Added to MASTERTODO.md as priority item for Herb Lubalin
- For now: Keep "Cuban Domino League" in both places (Capablanca's logic holds)
- Future: Once logo is created, revisit hero layout with logo in top-left

**Action taken:** Added CDL logo creation to MASTERTODO.md under Brand & Design and Herb Lubalin's section.

## Final Summary

| Item | Decision | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Tournament naming convention | CDL:[number] [Subtitle] | ✅ Approved |
| First tournament name | CDL:1 La Salida | ✅ Approved |
| Hero hierarchy | League presents → La Salida → Tagline → Details | ✅ Approved |
| CDL:1 placement | Supporting locations, not hero | ✅ Approved |
| "Tournament" vs "Championship" | **Championship** | ✅ Approved |
| Double "Cuban Domino League" | Keep both for now, logo to MASTERTODO | ✅ Resolved |

---

## Session Complete

All decisions made. Hero now reads:

```
CUBAN DOMINO LEAGUE
presents

La Salida

The First Cuban Domino League Championship
January 31, 2025 • Mr Garcia Cigars
```

**Next step:** Create CDL logo (assigned to Herb Lubalin in MASTERTODO)

## Agenda Item 6: "La Salida" Typography — Gradient vs Solid

### The Question

The "La Salida" text had a brass-to-copper gradient. Is this necessary or does it distract from the power of the word itself?

### Team Discussion

**Herb Lubalin:**
> "Typography isn't just letters — it's architecture. And architecture doesn't need glitter. The gradient is doing work the letterforms should do themselves. Bodoni Moda is already elegant, already authoritative. When you add a gradient, you're saying 'I don't trust the type to carry the weight.'
>
> **My vote: Solid brass.** Let the letterforms breathe."

**Wifredo Lam:**
> "The golden tones are correct — they honor Ochún. But the gradient feels like a digital trick, not a truth. When my grandfather called me to the table, his voice was not a gradient. It was solid. Present. Real.
>
> 'La Salida' should feel carved — like it was always there. Carved things are solid. They don't shimmer. They endure.
>
> **My vote: Solid brass or copper.**"

**George Lois:**
> "Does the gradient make 'La Salida' SCREAM louder? Or is it whispering 'look how pretty I am'? The word is strong. Don't dress it up. Let it punch."

### Decision

**✅ APPROVED: Solid Brass**

- Removed gradient from hero "La Salida"
- Removed gradient from Rules panel "La Salida"
- Now using solid `var(--brass)` color
- Added subtle text-shadow for depth (not decoration)

### Updated CSS

After live browser testing, we refined further:

```css
.event-numeral {
  color: var(--cream);  /* Changed from brass to cream for max contrast */
  text-shadow:
    0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9),
    0 6px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5),
    0 0 80px rgba(212, 165, 116, 0.2);  /* Subtle warm glow */
}

.hero-tagline {
  font-size: clamp(0.7rem, 1.5vw, 0.85rem);  /* Smaller */
  letter-spacing: 0.2em;  /* More spaced */
  opacity: 0.75;  /* Pulled back */
  margin-top: 20px;  /* More breathing room */
}
```

### Final Result

- **"La Salida"** - Warm cream (`var(--cream)`) with subtle brass glow
- **Tagline** - Smaller, lighter, more spaced — doesn't compete
- **Hierarchy** - Crystal clear: Crown → Title → Context → Details
