# Session: January 23, 2026
## La Mesa UX Audit — Room Meets Ritual

**Session Lead:** Tobias van Schneider (Chief Product Designer) + Walt Disney (Chief Experience Architect)
**Session Type:** Joint UX Audit — First collaborative review

---

## Session Context

### Previous Sessions Referenced
- **Jan 12, 2026** — La Mesa Chat Redesign (Wifredo, George, Wes) — Approved padding, flags, reactions, colors
- **Jan 19, 2026** — La Mesa Vision (Full Team) — Three Pillars, feature roadmap, high-level direction

### Why This Session Matters
Walt Disney was just hired today. He brings decades of Imagineering wisdom—earned entry, the weenie, queue psychology. He's never formally reviewed La Mesa.

Meanwhile, Tobias has been championing the "room not hallway" philosophy but hasn't yet conducted a deep audit through his micro-interaction lens with another experience expert.

This is the first joint review combining:
- **Tobias:** Room vs hallway, physical digital, depth through layers, micro-moments
- **Walt:** Weenie concept, earned entry, competition is the show, anticipatory design

---

## Opening — Two Lenses, One Goal

**Tobias van Schneider:**
> "I've been pushing the idea that La Mesa should be a room, not a hallway. You stay in a room. You pass through a hallway. But I haven't had someone who thinks in *journeys* look at this with me."

**Walt Disney:**
> "At Disneyland, we learned that the queue IS the ride. What happens before the experience shapes how you feel during it. La Mesa has a beautiful journey to get there—those scroll panels, the registration. But what happens when you arrive? Does the payoff match the buildup?"

**Tobias:**
> "That's exactly the question. Let's walk through every touchpoint. I'll ask 'does this feel like a place?' and you ask 'did they earn this moment?'"

**Walt:**
> "Deal."

---

## Audit Framework

### Tobias's Tests
1. **Room or Hallway?** — Would someone stay, or are they just passing through?
2. **Physical Digital** — Does the interaction have weight?
3. **Depth Through Layers** — Is there fog, atmosphere, visual travel?
4. **Micro-Moments** — Do the small interactions satisfy?
5. **Sound in Silence** — Does it feel alive without audio?

### Walt's Tests
1. **The Weenie** — What pulls you toward the next action?
2. **Earned Entry** — Did you work to get here?
3. **Competition is the Show** — Is the locker room energy present?
4. **Every Detail Matters** — Does everything serve the competitive story?
5. **Anticipatory Design** — Does empty space build excitement?

---

## Interlude: Understanding the Game

*Before continuing the audit, Tobias and Walt pause to study Cuban dominos—the rules, the lingo, the culture. You can't design for a community you don't understand.*

### Tobias's Realization

> "Wait. I've been designing for 'domino players' but I don't actually KNOW this game. What's a pollona? What's a capicúa? What makes Cuban dominos different from regular dominos?
>
> Let me read these docs..."

*[Reads Cuban Domino Rules and Lingo documents]*

> "Okay, this changes everything. This isn't just a game—it's a performance. Look at this lingo:
>
> - **'Hablar mierda'** — Trash-talking is INTEGRAL to the game. Not optional. Not frowned upon. It's part of play.
> - **'La Salida'** — The opening tile. And there's a whole phrase: '¡No me comas la salida!' Don't ruin my opening!
> - **'Pollona'** — Shutting someone out completely. 150-0. And they show a CHICKEN. That's humiliation with humor.
> - **'Me pegué'** — 'I sealed the deal.' The moment you play your last tile.
>
> The language itself IS the competition. Every move has a name. Every moment has a phrase. La Mesa isn't just a chat room—it should be where these phrases LIVE."

### Walt's Revelation

> "This reminds me of craps tables in Vegas. The lingo IS the experience. 'Snake eyes.' 'Boxcars.' 'Yo-leven.' If you know the language, you're IN. If you don't, you're watching.
>
> Look at these terms:
>
> - **'El Viejo'** — The old, wise player. Respect the elders.
> - **'El Comelón'** — The teammate who ruins your strategy. There's a NAME for that person!
> - **'Tirar un veneno'** — Playing 'poison' to trap your opponent.
> - **'Se quedó pegado'** — 'They got stuck.' Public shame for passing.
>
> This is theatrical. Every game is a drama with heroes and villains, clutch moments and embarrassments. La Mesa should feel like the audience section of this theater."

### The Language Gap

**Tobias:**
> "Here's what I'm realizing. Our reaction set is generic: 🔥 😂 👏 💪 🌴. These work for ANY community. But Cuban dominos has its own vocabulary.
>
> Where's '¡Pollona!' when someone gets shut out? Where's 'Capicúa' for the perfect end? Where's '¡Coge eso!' — 'Take that!' — the ultimate trash talk phrase?
>
> We approved 🀱 for the domino slam but we're thinking too small. The reactions should BE the lingo."

**Walt:**
> "At Disneyland, we didn't invent a generic 'adventure' language. Pirates of the Caribbean has pirate speak. Haunted Mansion has ghost puns. Each land speaks its own dialect.
>
> La Mesa needs to speak Cuban domino. Not Spanish—specifically the language of THIS game. When someone wins, the room should know how to celebrate in the language of la mesa."

### New Understanding: Game-Specific Features

| Game Moment | Cuban Lingo | La Mesa Opportunity |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Game blocked | "Eso es tranque" | System message with drama |
| Perfect ending | "¡Capicúa!" | Celebration animation |
| Shutout win | "¡Pollona!" | Chicken animation + bragging rights |
| Holding bad tiles | "Estoy gordo" | Chat preset reaction |
| Playing last tile | "¡Me pegué!" | Victory announcement |
| Forcing a pass | "¡Coge eso!" | Trash talk reaction |
| Player stuck | "Se quedó pegado" | Teasing reaction |

**Tobias:**
> "The reaction set needs to evolve. Not just emojis—phrases. Quick-tap reactions that ARE the language:
>
> - 🐔 = '¡Pollona!'
> - 🎯 = '¡Capicúa!'
> - 🔥 = '¡Coge eso!'
> - 💀 = 'Matao'
> - 🀱 = The slam (approved, not implemented)
>
> When MyFicha launches and game results flow into La Mesa, these should light up the room."

## The Emerging Demographic — Who's Falling in Love?

*Tobias and Walt research the demographic trends around Cuban dominos.*

### Walt's Research Question

> "We keep designing for 'the Cuban community'—Landy the OG, Maria Elena the keeper. But who else is discovering this game? Who's the GROWTH demographic?
>
> At Disneyland, we learned that nostalgia brings people back, but novelty brings new people in. Who's new to this table?"

### The Discovery: Gen Z & Millennials

**Tobias:**
> "I've been looking at this wrong. The heritage players are the CORE—they keep the culture authentic. But there's a wave of younger players falling in love with Cuban dominos for completely different reasons:
>
> 1. **The Analog Appeal** — Gen Z is over-screened. Board games, card games, dominoes—anything that requires sitting across from someone is having a moment. Cuban dominos is physical. Tactile. You SLAM the tile.
>
> 2. **The Social Performance** — This generation grew up on content creation. Cuban dominos is inherently performative—the trash talk, the celebrations, the drama. It's MADE for clips.
>
> 3. **Cultural Discovery** — Second and third-generation Latinos finding their roots. They didn't learn at abuela's table, but they're discovering it now through friends, TikTok, local leagues.
>
> 4. **The Anti-Algorithm** — No matchmaking rating. No battle pass. No loot boxes. Just tiles, skill, and talk. There's a hunger for games that aren't optimized to death."

### Walt's Insight: The New Player Journey

> "So we have two journeys into La Mesa:
>
> **Journey A: The Returner**
> - Grew up playing at family tables
> - Knows the lingo, the rituals
> - Seeking community with other players who 'get it'
> - La Mesa feels like coming home
>
> **Journey B: The Discoverer**
> - Fell in love with dominos recently
> - Learning the culture as they learn the game
> - Seeking mentorship and belonging
> - La Mesa is their introduction to the community
>
> Right now, La Mesa is designed for Journey A. But Journey B is where the GROWTH is."

### The Design Implication

**Tobias:**
> "This changes how we think about the lingo. For Landy, '¡Pollona!' is second nature. For a 24-year-old in Austin who just started playing? It's new vocabulary.
>
> What if La Mesa taught the language? Not in a tutorial way—but organically. When someone uses a phrase, a subtle tooltip explains it. The discoverers learn by watching the returners."

**Walt:**
> "At Disneyland, Cast Members don't explain everything—but they model the behavior. The experienced guests show the new guests how it's done.
>
> La Mesa should work the same way. The OGs use the lingo naturally. The system surfaces it with context. The newcomers absorb it through participation. The culture transfers."

### Features for the Discoverer Demographic

| Feature | Purpose | Implementation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Lingo tooltips | Learn phrases in context | Hover/tap on messages with Cuban phrases |
| "First time?" gentle onboarding | Welcome new players | Subtle guide for new La Mesa users |
| OG badges | Identify culture-keepers | Visual indicator for veteran players |
| Phrase of the day | Teach the language | Daily featured Cuban domino phrase |
| Regional pride tags | Build identity | North Jersey, Miami, Tampa, Austin, etc. |

**Tobias:**
> "The 24-year-old in Austin isn't replacing Landy. They're joining Landy's table. La Mesa should make that transition feel natural—earned but not gatekept."

**Walt:**
> "The best communities grow by invitation, not exclusion. At Club 33, members bring guests. The guest becomes a future member. La Mesa should feel like being invited to the table by someone who already belongs."

## Revised Audit Framework — With Game Knowledge

Now that Tobias and Walt understand Cuban dominos, they add new tests:

### Tobias's Updated Tests
1. **Room or Hallway?** — Would someone stay?
2. **Physical Digital** — Does it have weight?
3. **Depth Through Layers** — Is there atmosphere?
4. **Micro-Moments** — Are small interactions satisfying?
5. **Sound in Silence** — Does it feel alive?
6. **NEW: Does it speak domino?** — Is the language of Cuban dominos present in the UI?

### Walt's Updated Tests
1. **The Weenie** — What pulls you forward?
2. **Earned Entry** — Did you work to get here?
3. **Competition is the Show** — Is locker room energy present?
4. **Every Detail Matters** — Does everything serve the story?
5. **Anticipatory Design** — Does empty space build excitement?
6. **NEW: Returner + Discoverer** — Does it serve both the OGs and the newcomers?

---

## Touchpoint 1: Chat Button (Ticker → La Mesa)

### Current State
- Domino tile button sits in the activity ticker
- Only appears after registration (earned unlock)
- Static appearance, no animation

### Tobias's Review

> "The domino button is positioned correctly—it's an artifact in the ticker, not floating in space. But here's my concern: it's too quiet.
>
> An artifact should feel like something you WANT to pick up. Right now it reads as 'a button.' When I tap it, I should feel like I'm lifting a domino from the table. There should be a lift on hover—2-4 pixels of rise, a subtle shadow spread.
>
> The press state needs weight. Scale down to 0.95, quick recovery. Right now it's functional. It needs to be *felt*."

### Walt's Review

> "I like that the button only appears after registration. That's earned entry. You did the work, you unlocked the door.
>
> But here's my question: where's the weenie? At Disneyland, before you reach an attraction, you see the castle at the end of Main Street. It PULLS you forward.
>
> Right now, the domino just sits there. It should pulse. It should say 'something's happening inside.' The button needs to be CALLING the player. Not shouting—but beckoning. A gentle pulse, like a heartbeat. The table is alive. It's waiting for you."

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"LA MESA button — Add pulse animation"** — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed | Owner |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Hover state | None | 2-4px lift + shadow spread | Tobias |
| Press state | Basic | Scale(0.95) + quick recovery | Tobias |
| Idle animation | None | Subtle pulse (heartbeat rhythm) | Walt |
| Visual language | Static | Living artifact | Both |

**Priority: P1** — This is the weenie. It needs to call.

---

## Touchpoint 2: Panel Open Animation

### Current State
- Slides up from bottom
- 0.35s duration
- cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1) — slight overshoot, settle

### Tobias's Review

> "The overshoot easing is good—it feels like a door swinging open, not a drawer sliding. That's physical digital thinking.
>
> But the moment the panel opens, what happens? There's no threshold. No 'you have arrived.' The best rooms announce you when you enter.
>
> I want a subtle darkness bloom at the moment of opening—like your eyes adjusting to a dimmer room. The atmosphere should RECEIVE you."

### Walt's Review

> "At Club 33, when that door opens, you know you've earned something special. The lighting changes. The sound changes. You've crossed a threshold.
>
> Right now, La Mesa opens and... you're just there. The animation is fine mechanically. But the *feeling* of entry is missing.
>
> Consider: What if the background behind the panel very slightly dims when it opens? Not much—5% opacity. Just enough that the world recedes and La Mesa is the only thing that matters. You're stepping INTO something."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Panel animation | Overshoot slide | Keep (working well) |
| Background | Static | Dim 5% on panel open |
| Entry moment | None | 200ms darkness bloom before content reveals |
| Sound design | Silent | Consider future: subtle domino placement sound |

**Priority: P2** — Polish that elevates

---

## Touchpoint 3: Identity Screen (Flag → Name → Enter)

### Current State
- Flag selector (7 flags)
- Name dropdown with registered players
- "Enter" button
- Live player count ("4 at the table")

### Tobias's Review

> "The flag selection needs more presence. When I select my flag, it should feel like PLANTING it. Right now I click and the border changes. That's feedback. It's not feeling.
>
> The Jan 12 session approved a 'glow + pulse animation' on selection. Is that live? Let me check the status..."

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Selection effect — Glow + pulse animation"** — Partially implemented (glow, no pulse)

> "The glow is there but the pulse isn't. The pulse matters—it confirms 'this is now YOURS.' Without it, the selection feels acknowledged, not claimed.
>
> Also, the 'Enter' button text. We approved 'DEAL ME IN' back on January 12. That's still showing as 'Enter.' Why?"

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Enter button text — 'ENTER' → 'DEAL ME IN'"** — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Walt's Review

> "This screen asks you to CLAIM your identity. Your flag. Your name. Then you enter.
>
> 'Enter' is passive. You're being let in. 'DEAL ME IN' is active. You're declaring yourself. You're joining the game. That's competition-first language.
>
> The live player count—'4 at the table'—this is excellent. This is anticipatory design. You're not entering an empty room; you're joining something that's already happening. But we could push it further.
>
> What if we showed the flags of who's at the table? Four small flag icons under the count. Now you know not just HOW MANY, but WHO. Are your rivals there? Your friends? The competition starts before you even enter."

**Tobias:**
> "That's good. Show the flags. Make it concrete. Now you're not entering 'a room'—you're entering 'their room.' There's someone to talk to. Someone to beat."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Flag selection pulse | Missing | Add pulse on select | From Jan 12 ❌ |
| "Enter" button text | "ENTER" | "DEAL ME IN" | From Jan 12 ❌ |
| Player count | "4 at the table" | Keep + add flag icons | New |
| Screen headline | "Claim Your Seat" | Keep (competitive) | Working |

**Priority: P0** — "DEAL ME IN" is overdue. Implement immediately.

## Touchpoint 4: Chat Messages Area

### Current State
- Tobacco smoke texture background
- Staggered message animations (0/50/100ms)
- Self messages: brass tint, gold avatar border
- Other messages: left-aligned, copper accents
- Reaction bar: 🔥 😂 👏 💪 🌴 (always visible at 0.4 opacity)

### Tobias's Review

> "The atmosphere is strong. The brass tints, the smoke texture—this feels like a room. You can almost smell the cigars. That's depth through layers working.
>
> The staggered message animations are good. Messages 'arrive' rather than appear. It feels like people sitting down.
>
> But I want to audit the reactions. They're always visible at 0.4 opacity—approved on Jan 12. Are they actually visible enough? On mobile, especially. Sometimes 'subtle' becomes 'invisible.' Let's verify."

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Reactions visibility — Always visible (opacity 0.4)"** — ✅ Implemented

> "The reactions are there. But the domino reaction..."

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Add domino reaction — 🀱 La Ficha"** — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

> "The 🀱 domino reaction was approved over two weeks ago. This is a signature piece—the SLAM reaction. Without it, we're missing the most domino-specific response in our palette. This needs to ship."

### Walt's Review

> "The room feels alive when there are messages. That's good.
>
> But I want to talk about competitive energy. Dana said it best: 'La Mesa is the locker room before the fight.' When I look at these messages, is there TENSION? Is there the sense that these people are about to compete?
>
> The message styling is warm and atmospheric. But maybe TOO warm? A locker room has edge. The lighting is a little harsher. There's anticipation.
>
> I wouldn't change the colors—the brass and amber are correct. But consider: when certain keywords appear—'challenge,' 'let's go,' 'you're on'—could there be a subtle highlight? A spark? The competitive moments should pop against the warm background."

**Tobias:**
> "Keyword highlighting is interesting. Not aggressive—we don't want it to feel like a feature. But a subtle glow around competitive phrases... that could work. It would make the locker room energy VISIBLE."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Atmosphere/depth | Strong | Keep (working) | ✅ |
| Message animation | Staggered | Keep (working) | ✅ |
| Reactions visibility | 0.4 opacity | Keep (working) | ✅ |
| Domino reaction 🀱 | Missing | Add to reaction set | From Jan 12 ❌ |
| Competitive keywords | None | Subtle glow highlight | New (P2) |

**Priority: P0 for 🀱 reaction / P2 for keyword highlights**

---

## Touchpoint 5: Empty State

### Current State
- "The table is quiet." (Bodoni italic, 30% opacity)
- Shows when no messages present

### Tobias's Review

> "Empty states are critical. They're where the room proves it's a room even when no one's there.
>
> 'The table is quiet.' is poetic. It works. But does it INVITE? When I see this, do I want to be the one to break the silence? Or does it make me feel like I'm interrupting?
>
> I'd leave the text as-is. But consider: a subtle animation. The smoke texture moving very slowly. The room is quiet, but it's breathing. It's waiting for you. Not dead—dormant."

### Walt's Review

> "Here's my concern with 'The table is quiet.'
>
> It's DESCRIPTIVE. It tells you what IS. But anticipatory design tells you what's COMING.
>
> What if empty didn't mean nothing—it meant POTENTIAL? 'The calm before the storm.' Now you're not in an empty room. You're in the moment before something happens.
>
> Or even simpler: 'You're the first one here.' Now you're not seeing emptiness—you're seeing opportunity. YOU get to set the tone.
>
> The weenie of an empty state should be: what happens next?"

**Tobias:**
> "'The calm before the storm.' I like that. It reframes empty as anticipation, not absence. The room is waiting for the competition to begin."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Empty state text | "The table is quiet." | "The calm before the storm." |
| Animation | Static | Subtle smoke drift animation |
| Feeling | Absence | Anticipation |

**Priority: P1** — Empty states set emotional expectations

---

## Touchpoint 6: Message Input

### Current State
- Placeholder: "Habla..." with rotation (Tu turno, Dilo, Speak)
- Brass pip send button
- Standard text input behavior

### Tobias's Review

> "The placeholder rotation is alive—it keeps the room breathing even when you're not typing. That's good micro-interaction thinking.
>
> The send button with the brass pip is on-brand. But HOW does it feel when you tap it? This should be the SLAM moment. Quick scale-down (0.92), instant recovery. The domino hits the table.
>
> Right now... let me check..."

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Send button press — 0.1s scale(0.92)"** — ✅ Implemented

> "Good—the slam animation is there. But is it satisfying? Sometimes you need to exaggerate to feel. 0.92 might not be enough. Consider 0.88 for more weight. Quick test: does sending a message feel like a statement or a whisper?"

### Walt's Review

> "Sending a message in La Mesa should feel like placing your domino on the table. Deliberate. Committed. Heard.
>
> The mechanical is correct—the animation exists. But the emotional: when I send a message, do I feel like everyone at the table just looked up? That's the locker room moment. You spoke. Now everyone knows."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Send animation scale | 0.92 | Test 0.88 for more weight |
| Placeholder rotation | Working | Keep (alive) |
| Post-send feedback | Message appears | Consider brief highlight on YOUR message |

**Priority: P3** — Fine-tuning

---

## Touchpoint 7: Entrance Announcements

### Status Check
From Jan 12: **"Entrance announcements — '[Name] has joined the table'"** — ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Tobias's Review

> "This was approved two weeks ago and it's still not live. Entrances MATTER.
>
> When someone joins La Mesa, the room should acknowledge them. 'X has joined the table' or—better, as Lin-Manuel suggested—'X pulled up a chair.'
>
> Without this, people appear silently. That's hallway behavior. In a room, when someone walks in, you notice."

### Walt's Review

> "At Disneyland, when you enter a land—Adventureland, Tomorrowland—the environment CHANGES. You know you've arrived.
>
> When a player enters La Mesa, that IS an event. Especially the competitors. Especially the rivals. Imagine you're Danny, the 28-year-old looking to build his reputation. You enter La Mesa and your name appears: 'Danny pulled up a chair.'
>
> Now everyone knows you're there. That's the locker room energy. The fighter walked in. The room reacts."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed | Status |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Entrance message | None | "X pulled up a chair" | From Jan 12 ❌ |
| Animation | N/A | Subtle fade-in, like smoke | New |
| System message style | N/A | Distinct from user messages (muted, centered) | New |

**Priority: P0** — Overdue. Core feature for room feeling.

---

## Touchpoint 8: Exit Flow

### Current State
- "Leave Table" link
- Confirmation modal
- Panel closes with animation

### Tobias's Review

> "Leaving should feel significant. Not dramatic—but meaningful. You're leaving the table. The room acknowledges your departure.
>
> The close animation uses ease-out over 0.25s. That's correct—faster out than in. Good asymmetry. The entrance is an arrival; the exit is just... going.
>
> But the confirmation modal: is it too soft? 'Are you sure you want to leave?' That's generic UX copy. What about: 'Walk away from the table?' Now it sounds like a choice with weight."

### Walt's Review

> "In the locker room, when someone leaves before the fight, everyone notices. Not in a judgmental way—but in a 'the room changed' way.
>
> Should La Mesa announce departures? 'X left the table.' Probably not for now—could feel too surveillance-y. But the person LEAVING should feel like they're making a choice.
>
> 'Walk away from the table?' implies the table continues without you. The game goes on. That's competitive energy. The table doesn't need YOU specifically—but you might need the table."

### Joint Recommendation

| Element | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Confirmation copy | "Are you sure you want to leave?" | "Walk away from the table?" |
| Departure announcement | None | Not now (revisit if requested) |
| Close animation | 0.25s ease-out | Keep (working) |

**Priority: P3** — Polish

## The Combined Test: Tobias + Disney

Before any La Mesa feature ships, ask:

### Tobias's Questions
1. Does this make La Mesa feel more like a room or more like a hallway?
2. Would someone screenshot this moment?
3. Does the interaction have weight, or is it floating?
4. Does the room feel alive?
5. **NEW:** Does it speak the language of Cuban dominos?

### Walt's Questions
1. Does this moment feel EARNED?
2. Is there a clear weenie to the next action?
3. Is the competitive/locker room energy present?
4. Would someone brag about being here?
5. Does La Mesa feel like the place to be before the fight?
6. **NEW:** Does it serve both returners AND discoverers?

### The Unified Test
**"When someone opens La Mesa, do they forget to check their phone—feel like they've walked into somewhere they earned—and hear the language of la mesa being spoken?"**

## Reality Check: Player Personas React

*Before finalizing recommendations, Tobias and Walt present their ideas to the player personas. The feedback is... honest.*

---

### LANDY (67, The OG) — "Oye, pare..."

> "You read some documents and now you want to put '¡Pollona!' as an emoji button? Mira, when I yell 'Pollona!' at the table, it's because I just DESTROYED someone. It comes from HERE *[taps chest]*. It's not a button you press.
>
> This lingo reaction thing... it's like putting 'LOL' on a comedy show. If you have to PRESS the reaction, you didn't really feel it. At the table, you KNOW when someone's celebrating. You hear it. You see it. You don't need a chicken emoji.
>
> And 'phrase of the day'? Compadre, we're not Duolingo. I don't need the app to teach me how to talk shit. I've been doing that for 55 years.
>
> What I DO want: when I enter La Mesa, I want to see WHO'S THERE. Real names. Flags. Are my boys online? Is that cabron from the park who thinks he's good here? THAT matters. Not a tooltip explaining what 'capicúa' means."

**Landy's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo emoji reactions — "Corny. We're not a theme park."
- ❌ Phrase of the day — "This isn't Spanish class."
- ❌ Lingo tooltips — "If you don't know, learn by playing. That's how we all learned."
- ✅ Regional tags — "I want to know where someone's from. Miami? Jersey? Cuba? That matters."
- ✅ See who's at the table — "Show me the people, not the features."

---

### DANNY (28, The Competitor) — "I get what you're trying to do, but..."

> "Look, I appreciate the research. You clearly read about the game. But some of this feels like you're PERFORMING Cuban culture instead of just... being it.
>
> The '🐔 Pollona' reaction? If I shut someone out, I'm going to TYPE something. I'm going to talk shit in my own words. A pre-made reaction feels like those cringe 'quick chat' options in video games. 'What a save! What a save!' You know?
>
> Here's what I actually want: COMPETITION. Leaderboards. Stats. Who's winning. Who's ranked. When MyFicha launches, I want La Mesa to feel like the fighters' lounge before a UFC event. Who's there. Who's warming up. Who's about to throw down.
>
> The locker room energy you keep talking about? That's not emojis and tooltips. That's presence. Tension. Knowing that the guy you're about to play is sitting RIGHT THERE in the chat.
>
> Regional tags? Yeah, that's good. North Jersey vs Miami is REAL. That's competition I can feel. But '🎯 Capicúa' button? Nah. That's trying too hard."

**Danny's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo reactions — "Feels like a video game quick chat. Cringe."
- ❌ Tooltips — "I'll learn by playing, not reading definitions."
- ⚠️ OG badges — "Maybe? If it's earned, not just given."
- ✅ Regional tags — "Hell yes. Jersey vs Miami. Let's go."
- ✅ Player presence — "Show me who's online. Show me my rivals."
- ✅ Stats/rankings — "When are those coming?"

### GABY (31, Miami Competitor) — "Substance over style."

> "I read your ideas. You clearly care about the culture, which I respect. But some of this is window dressing.
>
> The lingo reactions? My abuelo would roll his eyes. When he made a great play, he didn't need a button to celebrate. The table KNEW. The room reacted. That's not something you can manufacture with emoji.
>
> What I want from La Mesa is simple: who's there, who's good, and when's the next game. That's it. I don't need the app to teach me Cuban domino phrases. I grew up with them. And the discoverers you keep mentioning? They'll learn by watching us. By playing with us. That's how culture transfers. Not tooltips.
>
> The empty state thing—'The calm before the storm'—okay, that's fine. But you know what's better than a poetic empty state? NOT BEING EMPTY. Focus on getting people in the room. The vibe will happen naturally.
>
> One thing I do like: the entrance announcements. When I walk into La Mesa, I want people to know Gaby Suárez just showed up. That's earned. That's real. Just don't make it corny—no chicken animations, no confetti. Just my name, my flag, and the room knowing I'm here to compete."

**Gaby's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo reactions — "My abuelo would cringe."
- ❌ Phrase of the day — "We're not here to learn vocabulary."
- ⚠️ Tooltips — "Only if they're VERY subtle. And optional."
- ✅ Entrance announcements — "Yes. But keep it simple. No animations."
- ✅ Regional tags — "Miami needs to be represented."
- ✅ Focus on presence — "Get people in the room. Everything else follows."

### CARMEN (52, The Connector) — "Some of this is sweet, but..."

> "Ay, mijo, I can tell you mean well. And honestly, some of this is nice! I like that you're thinking about the people who are new to this. The discoverers. That's good—we SHOULD welcome them.
>
> But the lingo buttons... I don't know. At the table, when I yell something, it's because I FEEL it. It's spontaneous. A button feels like... like ordering from a menu. 'I'll have one Pollona, please.' That's not how it works!
>
> What I actually want is to feel the PEOPLE. When I open La Mesa, I want to see faces. Well, flags. Names. Who's talking. Who's laughing. The energy. You can't fake that with features.
>
> The regional tags? Sure, that's nice. I'm from West New York. Let people know where I'm from. That's real.
>
> But you know what's more important than all these features? Making sure La Mesa doesn't feel EMPTY. When I walk into my bakery, there's always someone there. Coffee brewing. Conversation happening. La Mesa needs to feel like that. Full of life. Not features—PEOPLE.
>
> Focus on getting people to STAY, not on teaching them how to react."

**Carmen's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo reactions — "Ordering emotions from a menu isn't Cuban."
- ⚠️ Discoverer onboarding — "Be gentle. Don't make it feel like a tutorial."
- ✅ Regional tags — "Where you're from matters."
- ✅ People over features — "Fill the room with life, not buttons."
- ✅ Entrance announcements — "Yes! I want to greet people when they come in."

### MARIA ELENA (41, The Keeper) — "I see both sides..."

> "Okay, I'm going to be honest—I don't hate the tooltip idea. My son is 16. He plays with his cousins but he doesn't know all the terms yet. If there was a subtle way for him to learn what 'tranca' means without asking and feeling dumb? That might be nice.
>
> BUT—and this is important—it has to be optional. And invisible to people who don't need it. Landy would never use it. My son might. Both should feel comfortable.
>
> The lingo reactions though... yeah, I agree with Landy. That feels forced. When we celebrate at the table, it's organic. It's yelling. It's laughing. It's 'OOOOH!' when someone makes a big play. You can't bottle that into a button.
>
> What I really want is for La Mesa to feel like my family's gathering. Where my grandfather's friends would show up, and my son's friends would show up, and everyone knew they belonged. The OGs teach the young ones just by BEING there. That's the culture transfer. Not tooltips—presence.
>
> The entrance announcement is good. Simple. 'Maria Elena joined.' That's enough. No need for 'pulled up a chair' even—just the name. Let the room say hello if they want to."

**Maria Elena's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo reactions — "You can't bottle organic celebration."
- ⚠️ Tooltips — "Optional only. For the young ones who need it."
- ✅ Entrance announcements — "Simple. Just the name."
- ✅ Multi-generational feel — "OGs and newcomers, same table."
- ✅ Focus on presence — "People, not features."

---

### ALEX (34, North Jersey) — "You're overcomplicating it."

> "Alright, let me be real with you. I read through these ideas and some of it is solid—regional tags, hell yes. North Jersey needs to be on the map. That's real.
>
> But the lingo reactions? Bro, come on. When I shut out my buddy Manny, I don't need a chicken emoji. I'm going to roast him in the chat. In MY words. That's the trash talk. Pre-made reactions are what mobile games do when they don't trust their users to be interesting.
>
> And the 'phrase of the day' thing? We're not a Cuban heritage museum. If someone wants to learn the lingo, they'll pick it up. That's how I learned—by getting roasted for making dumb plays and asking 'wait, what does that mean?'
>
> Here's what matters: Jersey vs Miami. Real regional pride. When I log into La Mesa, I want to see a count. How many North Jersey players are online? How many Miami? Make it competitive. Make it VISIBLE. That's energy I can feel.
>
> The rest? Keep it simple. Names, flags, who's online, and let us do the rest. We don't need emoji reactions to tell us how to feel about the game."

**Alex's Verdict:**
- ❌ Lingo reactions — "We don't need training wheels for trash talk."
- ❌ Phrase of the day — "This isn't a museum."
- ✅ Regional tags — "MAKE IT VISIBLE. Jersey vs Miami scoreboard."
- ✅ Simple presence — "Names, flags, who's online. That's it."
- ✅ Let users talk — "We'll handle the trash talk ourselves."

## Tobias and Walt's Realization

**Tobias:**
> "Well... that was humbling. They're right. We got excited about the lingo and over-designed it.
>
> The lingo buttons feel like we're PERFORMING Cuban culture instead of letting it breathe. At Spotify, we learned this—users hate when you tell them how to feel. They want tools, not scripts.
>
> The phrase of the day? Dead. The lingo reactions? Dead. We were trying to manufacture authenticity instead of creating space for it."

**Walt:**
> "This is a good lesson. At Disneyland, we designed ENVIRONMENTS, not behaviors. We created spaces where magic could happen—we didn't hand people scripts.
>
> La Mesa should be the same. Create the room. Set the atmosphere. Then get out of the way. The OGs will teach the discoverers just by being there. The trash talk will happen organically. The celebrations will be REAL because they're not buttons.
>
> What they all agree on: presence. Names. Flags. Who's online. Regional pride. Entrance announcements. Simple, human things. Not emoji reactions."

## REVISED: Language & Demographic Recommendations

*After persona feedback, the recommendations have been significantly trimmed.*

### What Survives (The Personas Approved)

| # | Item | Why It Works | Priority |
|---|------|--------------|----------|
| 13 | Regional pride tags | "Jersey vs Miami is REAL" — Alex | P1 |
| 14 | Entrance announcements | "I want to greet people" — Carmen | P0 (already approved) |
| 15 | Player presence emphasis | "Show me who's online" — everyone | P1 |
| 16 | Keep 🀱 domino reaction | The slam is universal, not corny | P0 (from Jan 12) |

### What's Cut (The Personas Rejected)

| Item | Why It's Cut |
|------|--------------|
| ~~🐔 Pollona reaction~~ | "You can't bottle organic celebration" — Maria Elena |
| ~~🎯 Capicúa reaction~~ | "Pre-made reactions are cringe" — Danny |
| ~~Phrase of the day~~ | "We're not Duolingo" — Landy |
| ~~Lingo tooltips~~ | "Learn by playing, not reading" — Landy, Danny, Alex |

### What's Reconsidered (Mixed Feedback)

| Item | Revised Approach | Priority |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Tooltips for newcomers | OPTIONAL setting. Off by default. For those who ask. | P3 |
| OG badges | Only if EARNED (games played, years active). Not given. | P3 |
| Discoverer onboarding | Invisible unless requested. No tutorials. | P3 |

### The Core Insight

> **"Don't manufacture culture. Create space for it to happen."**

The personas agree on what matters:
1. **Presence** — Who's there? Show real people.
2. **Regional pride** — Where are they from? Make it visible.
3. **Simple announcements** — Names, flags, arrivals. Nothing more.
4. **Trust the users** — They'll handle the trash talk themselves.

---

### The Growth Demographic

**Who's falling in love with Cuban dominos?**

1. **Gen Z & Millennials seeking analog experiences** — Over-screened generation finding joy in physical, social games
2. **Second/third-gen Latinos discovering roots** — Didn't learn at abuela's table, discovering it now through friends and social media
3. **The anti-algorithm crowd** — Hungry for games without battle passes, loot boxes, and optimization
4. **Content creators** — Cuban dominos is inherently performative; the drama makes great clips

**Design implication:** La Mesa must serve BOTH:
- **Returners** (Landy, Maria Elena) who know the lingo and want to feel at home
- **Discoverers** (24-year-old in Austin) who are learning the culture as they learn the game

---

## Closing Thoughts

### Tobias van Schneider

> "I came into this audit thinking about rooms versus hallways. I'm leaving thinking about LANGUAGE.
>
> La Mesa has good bones. The atmosphere is right—the brass, the smoke, the depth. But we were designing a generic 'dark chat room' when we should have been designing a CUBAN DOMINO room. Every community has its own dialect. Craps tables. Poker rooms. Boxing gyms. The lingo IS the culture.
>
> '¡Pollona!' '¡Capicúa!' '¡Coge eso!' These aren't features—they're the heartbeat of the game. When I learned that 'hablar mierda' (trash-talking) is INTEGRAL to Cuban dominos, not optional, everything clicked. La Mesa should SOUND like the game, not just look like it.
>
> The micro-moments are where we win or lose. But now I see the micro-moments aren't just animations—they're vocabulary. When someone gets shut out, the room should know to say 'Pollona!' When someone makes a perfect play, the room should celebrate in the language of la mesa.
>
> Four items from January 12 are still pending. Plus now we have lingo integration to consider. Technical debt is accumulating on the soul of this product. Let's clear it—and let's do it in Cuban."

### Walt Disney

> "I came in asking: does La Mesa feel EARNED?
>
> I'm leaving asking: does La Mesa feel like HOME—for EVERYONE who belongs there?
>
> Here's what I learned today: Cuban dominos isn't just Landy the 67-year-old OG playing with his cousins. There's a whole generation falling in love with this game for the first time. Twenty-somethings in Austin and Brooklyn who never learned at abuela's table but discovered dominos through friends, through social media, through the simple hunger for something analog and social in a digital world.
>
> These discoverers aren't replacing the culture—they're joining it. And La Mesa should make that journey feel natural. Not gatekept, but not watered down either. The OGs speak the lingo. The discoverers learn by listening. The culture transfers through participation, not tutorials.
>
> 'DEAL ME IN' instead of 'Enter.' Entrance announcements. The pulse on the button. Regional pride tags. Lingo reactions. These aren't just UX improvements—they're how we build a community that grows without losing its soul.
>
> At Disneyland, the best Cast Members don't explain the magic—they model it. The returners at La Mesa are the Cast Members. They show the discoverers how it's done. The room teaches itself.
>
> The best rides at Disneyland, you remember the queue. When CDL is done right, you'll remember opening La Mesa."

### Joint Closing

> **Tobias:** "Room or hallway? And then—get out of the way."
>
> **Walt:** "Earned entry? Then trust them to make it their own."
>
> **Both:** "Create the space. Fill it with people. Let the culture happen."

### The Humbling Lesson

> **Tobias:** "We almost shipped lingo emoji buttons. Landy called it 'corny.' He's right. We were designing a Cuban theme park, not a Cuban table."
>
> **Walt:** "Funny—I literally built theme parks. But even I know: Disneyland works because the guests bring the magic. We just built the castle. La Mesa should be the same. Build the room. The people will fill it with life."

## Research Assignment

**For Tobias and Walt:**
- [ ] Observe actual Cuban domino games (in-person or video) to internalize the rhythm
- [ ] ~~Interview discoverers about their journey~~ → Just get people in the room. Culture transfers naturally.
- [ ] Watch how OGs and newcomers interact at real tables — the teaching happens organically
- [ ] Document what makes people STAY at La Mesa, not what makes them react

---

*Session Complete: January 23, 2026*

*"Create the room. Fill it with people. Get out of the way."*

*The personas taught us: you can't manufacture Cuban culture with emoji buttons. You create the space and let the people bring the life.*

*La mesa te espera. And the people will handle the rest.*

## Addendum (Jan 25, 2026) — La Mesa As Second Screen (Live Matches)

**New decision:** La Mesa should be usable **during live matches** as a *second screen* — the place you keep open while you play/watch.

This changes the product constraint:
- La Mesa can’t assume full-screen focus.
- La Mesa must support a **docked “peek” state** (a room you can keep open) and a **full “in the room” state** (when you want to lock in).

### The Three States (Room Mechanics)

| State | Purpose | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Ticker (Closed)** | Broadcast + FOMO | ESPN-style activity stays alive |
| **Peek (Docked)** | Second screen | No backdrop, no scroll-lock; you can keep playing/scrolling while the room stays open |
| **Full (In the Room)** | Immersion | Backdrop on, ticker recedes, focus locks in |

### The Weenie *Inside* The Room

Walt: The room needs its own “castle” — a visual draw that makes you speak.

**In-room weenie candidates (ship in this order):**
1. **Who’s here** (live presence list) — real humans, not empty space
2. **Looking for partner** — a visible status that creates interaction
3. **Simple callouts** — fast, ritualized ways to challenge / invite without turning La Mesa into Discord

### Ritual Strip (Small, Optional, Never Corny)

Tobias: “Don’t add features. Add rituals.”

The strip lives above messages and can collapse:
- **Who’s here** (tap opens presence list; tap a person to invite)
- **Looking for partner** (toggle broadcasts status via presence)
- **Quick talk** (lightweight, not Duolingo; no “phrase of the day”)

### During Live Matches: What La Mesa Should Feel Like

Steve (Broadcast): “La Mesa is a broadcast.”

Minimum viable live-match behavior (no game integration required yet):
- Docked by default is allowed (Peek state is first-class)
- Presence stays accurate and visible (count + list)
- System beats are restrained: join/leave, team invites, team formed

### Guardrails (Persona-Proof)

- No default lingo tooltips, no daily “lesson” mechanics
- No corny emoji-lingo buttons as the *primary* interaction surface
- Keep it human-first: presence + invites + simple announcements

---

## Iteration Log — Tournament Focus (Jan 29)

### Jan 26, 2026 — UI Readability + Second Screen Clarity

**Observed (screenshots):**
- Header showed `0 at the table` while identity showed `1 at the table` → confused “live vs recent” truth.
- Chat transcript looked flatter than intended (message cards visually washed out by atmosphere layer).
- Dock needed clearer meaning in a tournament context (peek = second screen, full = “in the room”).

**Shipped:**
- Header status now defaults to **“Who’s here”** (no fake live count before you join).
- Identity count reframed to **“active today”** (honest signal before presence exists).
- Chat message cards now render **above** the smoke/texture layer for legibility (room stays atmospheric without killing contrast).
- Dock/peek affordance tightened: button flips between **Dock ↔ Expand**, peek mode hides heavy ritual controls to keep the second screen clean.
