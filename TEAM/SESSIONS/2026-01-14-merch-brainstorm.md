# CDL Merchandise Brainstorm Session
**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Attendees:** Full Dream Team
**Purpose:** Explore branded domino sets, tables, and merchandise concepts

---

## Opening — Dana White (CEO)

> "Merch isn't just revenue. It's walking billboards. Every domino set we sell is someone bringing CDL into their home, their backyard, their family gatherings. This is how we scale culture."

**Key question:** What do people *actually* want to buy, and what makes CDL merch different from generic domino stuff on Amazon?

---

## The Products

### 1. CDL Branded Domino Sets

**Herb Lubalin (Brand Identity):**
> "The domino itself IS the logo. Every tile should feel like holding a piece of the league in your hand."

**Concepts:**

| Tier | Name | Description | Price Range |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Standard** | "La Mesa Set" | Double-nine dominoes, CDL branding on back, brass-colored pips, velvet drawstring bag | $35-45 |
| **Premium** | "El Campeón Set" | Double-nine in weighted resin, engraved CDL logo, wood case with brass hinges | $75-95 |
| **Collector** | "La Salida Edition" | Limited run, tournament-spec weight, numbered certificate, premium wood box, felt-lined | $150+ |

**Wifredo Lam (Artistic Director):**
> "The back of each tile should tell a story. Not just a logo — a symbol. The ceiba tree roots. The crossroads. Something that carries meaning."

**Design elements to explore:**
- [ ] CDL monogram on tile backs
- [ ] Brass/copper pip coloring (matches website palette)
- [ ] Cuban-inspired patterns (tobacco leaf, palm frond, geometric Afro-Cuban)
- [ ] Weight and feel — must have satisfying "slam" sound

**Wes Anderson (Visual Style):**
> "The packaging is half the product. A domino set should feel like opening a cigar box — anticipation, ritual, presentation."

**Packaging ideas:**
- [ ] Sliding wood box with brass clasp
- [ ] Felt-lined interior (deep brown or forest green)
- [ ] Printed rules card with CDL typography
- [ ] Small brass plaque: "Official CDL Tournament Set"

---

### 2. CDL Tables

**George Lois (Advertising):**
> "A CDL table in your home is a statement. It says: I take this seriously. This is where champions play."

**Table Concepts:**

| Model | Description | Target |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **"La Mesa" Folding** | Portable tournament table, felt top with CDL logo, brass corner accents, folds flat | Serious players, event organizers |
| **"El Círculo" Round** | 4-player round table, Cuban-style wood finish, inlaid CDL emblem, built-in cup holders | Home game rooms |
| **"La Bodega" Bar Height** | Standing height, weathered wood aesthetic, matches cigar lounge vibe | Bars, lounges, patios |

**Tobias van Schneider (Chief Product Designer):**
> "The table surface matters. That felt needs to be thick enough to absorb the slam but thin enough to feel the impact. And the color — not casino green. Something warmer. Tobacco brown or deep burgundy."

**Specifications to define:**
- [ ] Table dimensions (standard domino table size?)
- [ ] Felt color options (tobacco brown, forest green, burgundy)
- [ ] Wood finish (weathered oak, dark walnut, mahogany)
- [ ] Logo placement (center? corner? subtle or bold?)
- [ ] Cup holder / ashtray integration?

**Benny Binion (Tournament Ops):**
> "For tournaments, we need consistency. Every table identical. Players shouldn't have an advantage based on where they sit. Standard height, standard surface, standard everything."

---

### 3. Apparel & Accessories

**Jay-Z (Chief Brand Officer):**
> "CDL merch has to work in two contexts: at the tournament, and on the street. It can't just be 'sports merch.' It has to be something you'd wear to dinner."

**Daisy Expósito-Ulla (Marketing):**
> "The Cuban community loves representing. But it has to be authentic. No cheesy tourist stuff. Think: subtle, quality, something your abuelo would approve of."

**Apparel Concepts:**

| Item | Description | Vibe |
|------|-------------|------|
| **"La Mesa" Guayabera** | Traditional Cuban shirt with subtle CDL embroidery on pocket | Authentic, tournament-wear |
| **CDL Camp Collar Shirt** | Bowling shirt aesthetic, small CDL patch, domino print lining | Retro cool |
| **"Slam" Tee** | Heavyweight cotton, simple CDL wordmark, vintage wash | Everyday wear |
| **"Your Seat's Waiting" Hoodie** | Premium hoodie, tagline on back, small logo front | Streetwear crossover |
| **CDL Dad Hat** | Unstructured cap, brass eyelets, embroidered domino tile | Universal |
| **"El Campeón" Chain** | Gold-tone chain with domino tile pendant | Statement piece |

**Wes Anderson:**
> "Color palette must be consistent. Cream, brass, tobacco brown, deep burgundy. No bright colors. Everything should feel like it belongs in the same world as the website."

---

### 4. Lifestyle & Home

**Tobias van Schneider:**
> "Think about the ritual. What surrounds the game? Cigars, cafecito, conversation. Our merch should enhance all of it."

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **CDL Cigar Ashtray** | Ceramic with brass trim, domino tile shape, 4 rests |
| **"La Mesa" Coasters** | Set of 4, domino tile design, cork bottom |
| **CDL Cafecito Set** | 4 espresso cups + saucers with subtle branding |
| **Domino Tile Ice Mold** | Silicone mold makes domino-shaped ice for rum drinks |
| **CDL Playing Mat** | Leather-look roll-up mat for playing anywhere |

---

## Manufacturing & Sourcing Discussion

**Dana White:**
> "Quality over quantity. I'd rather sell 100 premium sets than 1000 cheap ones. The CDL name has to mean something."

**Questions to resolve:**
- [ ] Domino manufacturer options (US-based? Import?)
- [ ] Minimum order quantities
- [ ] Sample production timeline
- [ ] Quality control process
- [ ] Packaging supplier

**Steve Lipscomb (Broadcast & Production):**
> "Every product is content. Unboxing videos, lifestyle shots, players using the gear. Build the merch launch into the content calendar."

---

## Priority Ranking

**Team consensus on what to develop first:**

1. **CDL Domino Set (Standard)** — Core product, must-have
2. **CDL Dad Hat** — Low cost, high visibility, easy win
3. **"Slam" Tee** — Basic apparel, test demand
4. **Tournament Table (Folding)** — Needed for events anyway
5. **Coaster Set** — Low cost, high gift potential

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] **Herb Lubalin:** Develop 3 logo variations for domino tile backs
- [ ] **Wes Anderson:** Create packaging mockups for Standard set
- [ ] **Tobias:** Specify exact domino weight, material, pip color
- [ ] **Dana:** Research domino manufacturers, get quotes
- [ ] **Daisy:** Survey community — what merch do they want?
- [ ] **George:** Develop taglines for each product tier
