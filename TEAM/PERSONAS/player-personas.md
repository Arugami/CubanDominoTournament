*Created: January 11, 2026*
*Purpose: Represent the target audience for website and marketing decisions*

---

## 1. ORLANDO "LANDY" FERNÁNDEZ, 67
**The OG**

**Background:** Came from Havana in 1980. Learned dominoes from his father in a solar in Centro Habana. Has been playing for 55 years. Retired mechanic. Plays every day at the park in Hialeah or at his friend's garage. Has never entered a formal tournament — "tournaments are for gringos."

**What he values:** Respect. Tradition. The ritual — the cafecito, the cigar, the trash talk. Winning matters, but HOW you win matters more.

**His concerns:** "Is this real Cuban dominoes or some watered-down thing for Americans?"

**Quote:** *"Say something about the years. About the fichas. About the people we learned from. THAT'S what gets me."*

---

## 2. MARIA ELENA CASTRO, 41
**The Keeper**

**Background:** Born in Union City. Never been to Cuba but the culture runs deep. Learned from her grandfather who passed away last year. Plays with her cousins at every family gathering. Works in hospital administration. Has a teenage son she's teaching the game.

**What she values:** Family. Legacy. Passing it down. Keeping her grandfather's memory alive through the game.

**Her concerns:** "Is this something I can bring my family to? Will it feel like home?"

**Quote:** *"Something like 'All those games at abuela's house' — THAT would hit me. That's real."*

---

## 3. DANNY REYES, 28
**The Competitor**

**Background:** Third generation Cuban-American from Miami. Plays in amateur leagues. Watches poker tournaments on TV and thinks dominoes deserves the same respect. Works in tech sales. Has been waiting for something like this.

**What he values:** Competition. Recognition. Proving that dominoes is a real sport, not just "something old people do."

**His concerns:** "Is this legit or just a casual hangout? Is there real competition?"

**Quote:** *"Tell me this is my chance to prove something. That all the practice matters now."*

---

## 4. CARMEN DELGADO, 52
**The Connector**

**Background:** Runs a Cuban bakery in West New York. Her shop is a community hub. Plays dominoes with customers, vendors, neighbors. Not the best player but everyone wants her at the table because she brings the energy.

**What she values:** Community. Laughter. The social glue that dominoes provides. The stories told between games.

**Her concerns:** "Will I fit in if I'm not a serious player? Is this just for the hardcore people?"

**Quote:** *"Make me feel like you KNOW me. Like you've been at the same tables I've been at."*

---

## 5. ALEX MARTINEZ, 34
**The North Jersey Competitor**

**Background:** Born and raised in Union City — "Havana on the Hudson." Parents came over in the Mariel boatlift. Grew up playing dominoes at his uncle's apartment on Bergenline Ave. Works in finance in Manhattan. Plays in a weekly game with childhood friends. Has been waiting for something official in the area — tired of hearing Miami gets everything Cuban.

**What he values:** Representing North Jersey. Proving the Cuban community up north is just as real as Miami. Competition with stakes. Showing his kids that their culture matters here too.

**His concerns:** "Is this a real thing or just a one-time party? Will this put North Jersey Cuban dominoes on the map?"

**Quote:** *"Miami thinks they own Cuban culture. We've been holding it down in Jersey for decades. It's time people see that."*

---

## 6. GABY SUÁREZ, 31
**The Miami Competitor**

**Background:** Third generation Cuban from Hialeah. Her abuelo was a legendary player at Domino Park on Calle Ocho. She learned from him before he passed and now carries the torch. Works as a physical therapist. Plays in a competitive women's league in Miami. Travels for tournaments.

**What she values:** Excellence. Representing the women who play at high levels. Honoring her grandfather's legacy. Competing anywhere there's real competition.

**Her concerns:** "Is the level going to be legit? I'm not traveling to play casuals. And will women be welcomed or is this an old boys' club?"

**Quote:** *"My abuelo said dominoes is chess with attitude. I play to win, not to socialize. Show me the best players and let's go."*

## How To Use These Personas

When making decisions about copy, design, features, or marketing:

1. **Read through each persona**
2. **Ask:** "How would Landy react? Maria Elena? Danny? Carmen?"
3. **Look for consensus** — if 3+ personas respond positively, it's likely a good direction
4. **Watch for exclusion** — if any persona feels left out, consider adjustments
