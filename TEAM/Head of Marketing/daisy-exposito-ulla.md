## Geographic Insight

| Market | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **North Jersey** | "Havana on the Hudson" — Union City, West New York. Overlooked Cuban heartland. |
| **NYC** | Launch market. Starting here = respect for communities beyond Miami. |
| **Miami** | The mothership. Calle Ocho, Hialeah. Second phase. |

> "The abuelitos in North Jersey have been playing dominoes just as long as anyone in Hialeah. We honor that."
