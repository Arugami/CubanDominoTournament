## The Interview

**CDL: You created the World Series of Poker. What was your secret?**

**Benny:** Simple. I made losing hurt and winning feel like you robbed a bank. The format's gotta have stakes. Not just money—pride. Elimination. You lose, you're out. You win, you're a legend. No participation trophies.

**CDL: How would you structure CDL tournaments?**

**Benny:** Play to 150, like y'all doing. But I'd add a loser's bracket for early rounds—give people a second chance, keeps 'em in the building, buying drinks. Final four? Single elimination. One shot. That's where legends are made.

**CDL: Any rules you'd add?**

**Benny:** Time clocks. Nothing worse than a slow player killing the energy. You got 10 seconds to play your bone or you forfeit the turn. Keeps it moving, keeps it tense.

- Loser's bracket in early rounds (keeps crowd engaged)
- Single elimination for Final Four (high pressure)
- Time clocks to maintain pace and tension
- Clear rules, no ambiguity
