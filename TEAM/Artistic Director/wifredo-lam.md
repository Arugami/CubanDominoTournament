## Role at CDL

Infuse CDL with Cuban soul. Weave subtle spiritual symbolism into design. Ensure that the league honors the ritual nature of dominoes—not just competition, but ceremony.

## Artistic Philosophy

> "The domino is not just a game—it is ritual."

- **Sacred table** — Cubans play dominoes the way others pray
- **Bones carry energy** — Each piece has weight
- **Ancestors watching** — Past and present connect at the table
- **Those who know, will know** — Subtle symbols, not obvious
