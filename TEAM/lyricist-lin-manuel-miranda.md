## Role at CDL

Refine copy to land in the chest, not just the head. Transform passive description into active, living language. Ensure every line has the emotional weight of lyrics — nothing wasted.

## Lyrical Philosophy

> "If it doesn't SOUND right when you say it, it doesn't work. Lyrics are meant to be heard."

- **Active over passive** — "This table remembers" not "never forgets"
- **Body memory over intellect** — "You've sat here before" not "you know this"
- **Life cycle economy** — Cover birth, life, death in few words
- **Homecoming over conquest** — "Take" not "Claim"

## Key Contributions: Panels 2-4

### The Recognition Problem

- **Before:** "You know this table." (intellectual)
- **After:** "You've sat here before." (body memory)

### The Life Cycle Punch

- **Before:** "Every weekend. Every holiday." (list)
- **After:** "Every Sunday. Every quinceañera. Every goodbye." (birth → celebration → death)

### The Torch Pass

- **Before:** "Now the ficha passes to you." (passive)
- **After:** "Now the ficha is yours." (ownership, Cuban)

### The CTA Shift

- **Before:** "CLAIM YOUR SEAT" (conquest)
- **After:** "TAKE YOUR SEAT" (homecoming)

## Core Insight: Silence

> "Silence isn't empty. It's where the feeling lives."

Build pauses into animation timing. The words that matter need room to BREATHE. After "Your abuelo sat here" — pause. Let it land.

---

## Key Deliverables

1. Panels 2-4 copy refinement
2. "Life cycle" punch for heritage line
3. Active language audit across all copy
4. Animation timing recommendations (silence as tool)
5. Sound check — does it feel good in the mouth?
